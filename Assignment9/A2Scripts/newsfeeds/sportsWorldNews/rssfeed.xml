                alt="Cliff Arjan BKP Combo Image"&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Boss Key Productions
                was founded by Cliff Bleszinski and&amp;nbsp;Arjan Brussee, who
                developed&amp;nbsp;Jazz Jackrabbit together in the '90s. Bleszinski stayed with
                Epic Games, working on the Unreal series and Gears of War, while Brussee helped
                lead Killzone developer Guerrilla Games. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cliff
                Bleszinski keeps calling&amp;nbsp; &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/lawbreakers/"&gt;LawBreakers&lt;/a&gt; “mature.”
                His characters aren’t&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/league-of-legends/"&gt;League of Legends&lt;/a&gt;’
                fantasy hodgepodge&amp;mdash;which he laughs about, suggesting cosplay is
                informing design in that case&amp;mdash;or&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/overwatch/"&gt;Overwatch&lt;/a&gt;’s likable cast
                of Pixar fighters. This is Cliff Bleszinski, the Unreal Tournament and Gears of
                War guy. His characters are mad and violent and one of them has electricity
                coming out of his face. They say swears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Truly, LawBreakers
                is just as goofy&amp;nbsp;as any other shooter coming out right now (the trailer
                above elaborates), just not&amp;nbsp;as smiley. It’s videogame-gritty,
                exaggerated and splattered with blood. It’s a silly but sensible direction:
                cartoon colors are in right now, so Bleszinski wonders if the green-and-brown
                era Gears of War spawned in isn’t due for a comeback. Maybe it is, but what’s
                more important to me&amp;nbsp;is that I had a lot of fun playing
                it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I played five early alpha&amp;nbsp;rounds of LawBreakers
                (see one of those rounds in the video embedded&amp;nbsp;below)&amp;nbsp;with
                press on a recent trip to Bleszinski’s studio, Boss Key, and was surprised I
                picked it up&amp;nbsp;so fast and enjoyed it so much, given that I’m not all
                that hot for other nouveau multiplayer&amp;nbsp;shooters like Overwatch. It
                isn’t entirely unlike that game, though, with a classic team&amp;nbsp;shooter
                core that’s been dipped in modernity:&amp;nbsp;character-based classes with
                special abilities whose cooldown timers leave a not unpleasant MOBA
                aftertaste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cruising altitude &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div
                class="fancy-box"&gt; &lt;h5 class="title"&gt;law vs. breakers&lt;/h5&gt;
                &lt;p&gt; &lt;img
                data-fullimage-src="http://ec0c5a7f741a6f3bff65-dd07187202f57fa404a8f047da2bcff5.r85.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/brApsN8FTmK0.jpg"
                src="http://e5c351ecddc2f880ef72-57d6ff1fc59ab172ec418789d348b0c1.r69.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/A5Y7yCHeqbXd.878x0.Z-Z96KYq.jpg"
                alt="LB KA PORTRAIT CRONOS-NoText"&gt; &lt;br&gt; The teams in LawBreakers are
                the Law and the Breakers (a bit on the nose, eh?). They have different
                characters, but those characters share identical classes, so there's no
                difference aside from names and looks. Here are the four classes that were
                available when I played. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
                &lt;strong&gt;Titan&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bomchelle
                (Law),&amp;nbsp;Chronos (Breakers)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
                &lt;br&gt; A rocket launcher, lightning rifle, and big dash and slam attack make
                Titan-class characters good base defenders. They can also slow enemies and go
                into a force lightning-like rage. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
                &lt;strong&gt;Enforcer&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Axel
                (Law),&amp;nbsp;Kintaro (Breakers)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
                &lt;br&gt; Your balanced attacker/defender. The enforcer carries an assault
                rifle, shock pistol, and can speed up movement, reloading, and shooting for
                herself and nearby allies. The class is topped off with HUD-distorting
                electromagnetic grenades and an ultimate that fires lock-on missiles. &lt;br&gt;
                &lt;br&gt;
                &lt;strong&gt;Assassin&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hellion
                (Law),&amp;nbsp;Kitsune (Breakers)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
                &lt;br&gt; The coolest class, assassins can zip around via grappling hook with
                dual machetes. A secondary shotgun punishes opponents who try to kite her,
                while&amp;nbsp;her Flux Blast abiliy knocks back enemies. Her ultimate
                ability,&amp;nbsp;Frenzy, shows&amp;nbsp;enemies through walls and regenerates
                health with each kill. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
                &lt;strong&gt;Vanguard&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maverick
                (Law),&amp;nbsp;Toska-9 (Breakers)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
                &lt;br&gt; My favorite class, Mavericks run with a primary gatling gun and
                secondary palm-blast of energy. Combined with her afterburners,
                her&amp;nbsp;Pulsar blasts make her very maneuverable in low-G, which her
                ultimate Starfall attack creates a pocket of after she slams into enemies on the
                ground. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; The special movement abilities are the
                best blend of old and new. I was first discouraged, then excited to find that
                the shift key doesn’t sprint, tossing out my left pinky’s years of training.
                There’s no generic sprint action at all: rather, each character has a different
                high-speed movement ability. The hulking rocket launcher guy charges forward and
                slams his fists down, but otherwise plods along like a sousaphonist. The
                assassin sweeps along the edges of the floating map in wide arcs, pivoting from
                a grappling hook. The vanguards fire afterburners to burst forward, flying
                inches off the ground for as long as their fuel lasts (it recharges when not in
                use), and can also shoot bursts of&amp;nbsp;energy from their palms to air-punch
                opponents or blast off the ground like Iron Man for a vertical
                leap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shooters that are excited about movement are shooters
                I’m excited about, and LawBreakers loves it. The small, arena-style setup
                doesn’t set it down next to Tribes on that front, but it similarly encourages
                the discovery of unique routes and the use of tricky maneuvers. The characters
                aren’t very fast on their own, but precise application of their abilities makes
                them go fast (they gotta), and I was bouncing around, dodging, feinting,
                flitting in and out of danger&amp;mdash;or at least, I sensed I could do all
                that if I spent more time practicing. As the assassin especially, I tended to
                gracelessly fall off the map more than grapple around poles like the deadly
                tetherball I know she can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To be fair, I was also getting
                to grips with LawBreaker’s gravity problems. The moon exploded or
                something&amp;mdash;that’s not important&amp;mdash;and now pockets of
                low-gravity space facilitate game design everywhere. In the gravity-free center
                of the map we played on just a few taps of my vanguard’s afterburners would send
                her arcing toward the upper level of the enemy base. Additionally, and this is
                most fun with rocket-launcher wielding titans, the left control key fires your
                weapon backwards for extra propulsion, and maybe a kill if you’re
                lucky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The team bases on the map I played on have regular
                gravity, but pockets of distorted space can also balloon out of special
                abilities to disorient and slow enemies. The vanguard’s ultimate
                ability&amp;mdash;the one with the longest timer, that is&amp;mdash;fires her
                into the air, then gives you a few seconds to target a cluster of enemies on the
                ground and rocket into them. After the explosion, a small low-G sphere pops
                open, sending your enemies’ shaken bodies drifting away from the blast. A light
                spray from her gatling gun finishes them off while they’re still trying to
                figure out which way is up. Used well, it feels like a choreographed sequence.
                If doing it over and over again will always be fun, I don’t know, but I was
                always pumped when the ability’s hotkey icon lit
                up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img

                you're just minding your own

                battery&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; The mode we played is similar to capture the flag,
                but not quite: there’s a single battery that spawns in the center of the level,
                and both teams, Law and Breakers, are trying to charge it up at their bases.
                Fully charging the battery initiates a countdown, at which point the other team
                must steal it off the enemy charger or forfeit a point. If the battery is
                stolen, though, it retains its charge. One team can spend the whole round in
                possession, filling the battery to 100 percent before losing after a clutch
                steal. It’s very intentionally designed to create those moments, and it
                works&amp;mdash;every battle felt like it came down to the last
                second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Every battle felt like it came down to the
                last second.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Respawn times are long enough to
                matter&amp;mdash;from a few seconds to over 10&amp;mdash;and movement speed
                isn’t all that fast unless you start burning your special ability (they all
                recharge, but it takes time), so kills don’t feel futile. Wipe out three or more
                players defending the enemy base and you’ve got time to snag the battery and jet
                into the map’s low-gravity center where you’re much harder to
                hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The guns aren’t something I can speak about in depth,
                given that I didn’t have a lot of time to assess them. The titan’s rockets act
                like we know rockets to act, requiring keen timing and the decision to go for
                splash damage or a direct gut shot&amp;nbsp;(and the character models really
                bust open, as if telefragged). Titans also have a secondary lightning gun-style
                weapon&amp;mdash;still a good time after&amp;nbsp;several
                shooter&amp;nbsp;iterations&amp;mdash;while other characters have some pairing
                of more traditional weapons with sci-fi twists, like an assault rifle with a
                spherical magazine. The only characters who currently grip melee weapons as
                their main are the machete-wielding assassins. I couldn’t quite get the hang of
                it or the grappling hook, but I was very satisfied when I did manage to zip into
                range and slice a guy into quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe width="560"
                height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HDA_nR12pA4" frameborder="0"
                allowfullscreen=""&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those melee kills aside, the
                characters are generally spongy, but the longer time-to-kill facilitates
                extended duels and encourages mixing up abilities. Vanguards, for instance, can
                throw a handful of high-damage contact grenades that are great for ending fights
                without having to reload. Or I might get in a couple seconds of sustained
                gunfire followed by a blast from her hand jet to splat gibs on the wall. Timing
                and targeting a special ability for the kill is always more satisfying than
                taking down an opponent by spitting regular old bullet holes through
                them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The death animations are worth talking about: I had a
                brief behind-the-scenes look at how the programmers merge animations and ragdoll
                physics to really double-down on Bleszinski’s brand of ‘maturity.’ If your
                finishing blow goes to the leg, for instance, it’ll kick out and the character
                will flop to the ground face first, or fly off into a zero-G grave leaving a
                trail of blood globules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I’m pleased by silly chunks of gore,
                and a little humbled by the work the Boss Key team presented during&amp;nbsp;
                &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/a-tour-of-boss-key-cliff-bleszinskis-new-studio/"&gt;my
                studio tour&lt;/a&gt;. Play games long enough and you start to get the sense
                that you know what they take to make, but I’ve never considered how to design a
                lighting system that ensures all characters, with their different shapes and
                outfits, are equally visible in dark parts of the map, or what FPS movement
                should look like in zero-G from the perspective of an observer who needs to know
                which way their opponent is moving and aiming. Boss Key aimed to impress with
                its behind-the-scenes look, and it did, revealing the sorts of details I
                might&amp;nbsp;gloss over while playing a game but would absolutely notice the
                absence of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img

                these screenshots look a bit too perfect, well, they are&amp;mdash;they were
                provided by Boss Key and aren't our own, but we did get to record video of a

                minds&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another design problem I’ve never considered the
                solution to, more understandably, is how to turn James Bond into the devil.
                Bleszinki’s staff doesn’t need prompting to have a laugh at their boss’ creative
                methods: concept artist Jay Hawkins explains to my
                tour&amp;nbsp;group&amp;nbsp;that after prototyping a fashionable spy character,
                Bleszinski suddenly decided the character should have goat horns. So with much
                reworking, the Bond character became a devil character on the Breakers side,
                with a cybernetic visor in the shape of horns (so that it fits into the fiction
                and isn’t just a guy with goat horns). That meant, of course, that an angel was
                in order on the Law side. “Wings don’t make sense,” says Hawkins, describing
                them as his “nightmare” while explaining the difficulty of designing
                cyber-feathers that look functional but don’t actually function, as the
                character has no flying abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; Bleszinski
                suddenly decided the character should have goat horns.
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trying ideas and tweaking them or throwing them out
                when they don’t work is part of the process. Another recent change to
                LawBreakers, for instance, is the business model. While it was originally going
                to be free-to-play, Bleszinski spoke at GDC 2016 about the frustration of
                considering monetization plans with every design decision. It was getting in the
                way, he says, so LawBreakers will instead take a buy-to-play model, similar to
                Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. When I ask Bleszinski if he plans to sell
                extras later on&amp;mdash;new characters, maps, maybe in one of the season
                passes EA likes to announce months before its shooters ship&amp;mdash;his answer
                is no, he won’t segment the players. Cosmetic items may be sold, but any new
                maps or characters will be free updates. And LawBreakers won’t be a $60
                game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “I think what you’re seeing, and you’re going to
                continue to see, is a massive shift in the multiplayer game arena, where it goes
                from $60 multiplayer games that kind of limped along at retail with tons of DLC
                to games that are kind of mid-range price, more impulse buy,” says Bleszinski.
                “I look at games like&amp;mdash;great games like Titanfall and Evolve to be
                fair, but I just don’t think they should’ve come out on disc at
                $60.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img

                never hit anyone with it, but firing behind your back just feels cool, and can
                be used as propulsion in low-G areas.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                Like a lot of other games today, though, LawBreakers will start its public life
                as an alpha. Bleszinski won’t confirm the definite plan, but he’s keen on the
                idea. “Is this the Early Access question?” he asks before I’ve actually said the
                words. “I mean, more and more people keep doing it for a reason, because a lot
                of triple-A games, they hit day one and they facepalm, because you’re basically
                issuing a denial of service attack on all their servers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                What we know now is that Boss Key is&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
                href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/350280" target="_blank"&gt;taking
                signups&lt;/a&gt; for the chance to participate in a series of alpha tests,
                though dates for those tests are unconfirmed. Based on my session, LawBreakers
                feels ready for that sort of free pre-release access. The interface and HUD are
                clean and readable, I didn’t encounter any bugs, and the four
                classes&amp;nbsp;feel like enough to play with in the short term. Then again, I
                played a very controlled preview build&amp;mdash;who knows what could go wrong
                in a wide release?&amp;mdash;and I don’t know how much more beyond the one map
                and one mode I saw is ready.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; The recognizable,
                comfortable fun of Unreal Tournament can have a hotbar and still respect
                movement and accuracy. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; So far, LawBreakers has
                demonstrated to me that the recognizable, comfortable fun of Unreal Tournament
                can have a hotbar and still respect movement and accuracy. My big questions now
                center around the characters and maps: how will relationships form between
                characters and their counters, as in the web of checks and cross-checks Team
                Fortress 2 has sewn? How creative will the maps be with gravity, and how
                creative can they be before they’re too complex? What will be the one map that
                defines LawBreakers?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I didn’t have time to ask Bleszinski
                every question in my head, but we’ll likely have more answers soon. LawBreakers
                will be playable at PAX East this week, and it already has &lt;a
                href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/350280/"&gt;a Steam&amp;nbsp;store
                page&lt;/a&gt; with a ‘Summer 2016’ release. Whether that release will be in
                Early Access or not is yet to be determined. Whenever it’s out, though, I’m
                confident that LawBreakers can challenge its cute and colorful competition. Not
                so much with blood and cursing&amp;mdash;I actually wish the
                mean-ass&amp;nbsp;characters were more endearing&amp;mdash;but with grappling
                hooks, afterburners, and low-gravity no-look behind-the-back
                headshots.&lt;/p&gt;

                alt="Briefcase 1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As videogame developer origin stories
                go, Richard Seabrook’s is far from orthodox. After studying for a degree in
                Computers Games and Business at university, the Bournemouth-based Seabrook moved
                into QA testing as a means of breaking into the industry. When this didn’t work
                out, he created an unofficial sequel to Opposing Force&amp;mdash;Gearbox’s
                Half-Life add-on&amp;mdash;put it on a USB, wrote a CV and a covering letter,
                and packaged the lot along with his university dissertation into a briefcase
                emblazoned with the Half-Life logo. He then sent this to Gabe Newell in the hope
                of getting a job at Valve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It definitely arrived. “It got
                signed-in by a guy called Diaz in the mailroom,” Seabrook says. “So if Diaz does
                read what you put out: I want answers, Diaz.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His
                game, Prospekt, is out now on Steam, but not because Valve was charmed by his
                DIY endeavours. In fact, Valve hasn’t so much as mentioned the briefcase since
                receiving it, despite Seabrook’s continued efforts to elicit a response.
                Prospekt instead performed well on Greenlight, where it garnered enough interest
                to justify its recent full release on Steam.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I
                watched that briefcase from the moment it got onto the UPS van,” Seabrook says.
                The contents of the&amp;nbsp;package cost well over £100 and for an indie
                developer subsisting on a budget of minimum wage plus tips from a late night
                cocktail bar job, this was a big investment. “I tracked the flights, I tracked
                the vans and I tracked it all the way until it got to Bellevue,” he says. “So,
                yeah, it was like four o’clock in the morning and I was watching it go across
                the ocean. I thought: it’s nearly there, it’s nearly
                there!”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then nothing. Emails, phone calls,
                letters and follow-ups were all ignored or passed down the line. “I had one
                extension number for someone there but apparently they left,” Seabrook recalls.
                “That answer phone message is probably still on that
                phone.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img

                alt="Prospekt 1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At university, Valve’s Source engine was
                the basis of Seabrook’s 70-page dissertation, which explored puzzles in
                first-person shooter games, specifically those designed in the engine. Seabrook
                has long understood what makes Valve’s games tick, but has always appreciated
                the limited likelihood of success for budding developers trying to break into
                the industry. In 2011, he showcased his work online for the first time by way of
                a Valve-supported Portal map contest and received some encouraging feedback and
                distinguished plaudits as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While he admits being
                nervous as to how the map would be received, a download count of over 2,000, and
                average ratings of four and a half stars, sparked a streak of confidence in
                Seabrook that forced him out of QA to work on what would eventually become known
                as Prospekt. He’d work long hours into the night serving drinks, spend a few
                more tinkering with his game, get a few hours’ sleep, then start the cycle
                again.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;He’d work long hours into the night
                serving drinks, spend a few more tinkering with his game, get a few hours’
                sleep, then start the cycle again.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developing a
                pseudo sequel to 1999’s Opposing Force was a logical step as a debut project. He
                knew the Source engine inside out, he admired Valve, he wanted to work for them,
                and protagonist Adrian Shephard’s story is one that once captured
                many-a-Half-Life enthusiast’s heart, his own
                included.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sticking to a “very strict” alternate
                timeline within the Half-Life universe allowed Seabrook to compensate for his
                limited production capacity as a one-man outfit. The plan, he says, was for this
                game to become not only his first professional project, but also a job
                application.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The briefcase idea came about because
                I’d often seen things on YouTube of people sending stuff to Valve and they
                seemed to respond quite well to it,” Seabrook explains. “Also, I wanted to show
                them how much attention to detail I can pay to things and how I’m willing to go
                the extra mile.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img
                data-fullimage-src="http://0cb8dd5d2dc142d08f0f-eb3b436d25971e5860b39e72b0600342.r94.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/XwqrTSz8RN6C.jpg"
                src="http://e5c351ecddc2f880ef72-57d6ff1fc59ab172ec418789d348b0c1.r69.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/Y2gt7znLi58S.878x0.Z-Z96KYq.jpg"
                alt="Briefcase 2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Seabrook lacked in actual
                experience, he reckoned, he’d make up for with ingenuity and
                creative&amp;nbsp;flair as demonstrated by the suitcase. So many hours, so much
                effort and sacrifice went into making Prospekt, it seems almost cruel to be left
                hanging in such a way. He’d prepared for failure&amp;mdash;he knew this wasn’t a
                sure-fire way to land a job at Valve&amp;mdash;but he hadn’t bargained for being
                simply ignored.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After being met with silence,
                Seabrook sought Greenlight approval for his game and was given the go-ahead just
                72 hours after posting. Talks began with Valve and, although delighted and
                cautious not to push it, he gave the suitcase enquiry one last bash. Again,
                Valve was reticent.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happened to the briefcase?
                To this day, nobody knows. When UPS confirmed the elusive Diaz had signed for
                the parcel, Seabrook was devastated. Yet in a roundabout way it’s landed him
                where he is today: head of his own development company, Seacorp Technologies,
                and having just released his first game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have sat back when
                I’ve had a spare second and I’ve thought: would I do anything differently?” he
                says. “And I guess now that I’m here the answer is no, I wouldn’t. It’s got me
                to this stage. I’ve always wanted to start my own studio, it’s always something
                I’ve wanted to do, because I’ve got so many ideas that I want to create. I just
                didn’t realise it’d be so soon.”&lt;/p&gt;

                'ex-Witcher 3 devs' pretty much seals the deal. As Phil explained&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/seven-is-a-thief-inspired-isometric-rpg-from-former-witcher-3-devs/"
                target="_blank"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;, Seven is a&amp;nbsp;game set in a
                "non-linear sandbox world", where you'll run and jump and climb and sneak and
                all the other things mysterious&amp;nbsp;travellers sometimes&amp;nbsp;get up to
                in post-apocalyptic worlds. Sorry, in "beyond post-apocalyptic" worlds, which I
                guess is shorthand for 'has fantasy elements too'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first
                trailer for Seven has emerged, via&amp;nbsp;&lt;a

                target="_blank"&gt;IGN&lt;/a&gt;, and it's a doozy, presenting some lovely
                isometric environments seemingly&amp;nbsp;full of detail and life, interrupted
                occasionally by flying robo-tentacle monsters. How like life.&amp;nbsp;I
                particularly like the parkour element&amp;mdash;you'll bound across rooftops and
                pipes, and slide down ropes, in your quest to...well, I've no idea, as developer

                last year (publisher IMGN.PRO reckoned then that it would be done by the second
                half of 2016),&amp;nbsp;but you can find out a wee&amp;nbsp;bit&amp;nbsp;more

                is an atmospheric narrative adventure set in the fictional English village of
                Yaughton. This is not a review of Everybody's Gone to the Rapture&amp;mdash;you
                can find that &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture-review/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
                Rather, this is a review of a single, insignificant building within the game.
                Why? Hey, we once &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/call-of-duty-dog-the-definitive-pc-gamer-hands-on-review/"&gt;reviewed
                a dog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The pub. The local. The
                rub-a-dub-dub. The ol' boozer. The drunkard's delight. The woozy house. Whatever
                you call it, it's a British institution. I'm something of an expert on village
                pubs. I've worked in them, lived in them, been unable to stand up in them. I
                have befriended aging pub dogs called Alex who were addicted to smoky bacon
                flavoured crisps. Point being, I know what I'm talking about. And so, when I
                heard praise of Everybody's Gone to the&amp;nbsp;Rapture's depiction of
                little-England's quaint eccentricities, I took it upon myself to investigate.
                Does local establishment The Stars At Night stand up to scrutiny? Let's find
                out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Outside&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;img

                pub looks like&amp;mdash;from the three curved lights pointing to the sign, to
                the&amp;nbsp;pointless faux-lantern that signals how British people wish it was
                still the 18th Century. The windows feel authentic, the glass looks spot on, and
                the brickwork is an accurately grubby off-white.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Round the
                side, there's a lovely hanging sign. It's almost looks too good, in that it
                doesn't feature a grotesque caricature of a local historical figure whose only
                pleasure was shooting animals in the face.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div

                hanging&amp;nbsp;sign could be better. Maybe that's why the illustration is
                repeated on this a-board. I'm docking marks for this. A good a-board is more
                functional in nature&amp;mdash;acting as a public service announcement for news
                and events. "Lunch served 12-2pm!" "Tonight only! Folk night, featuring the
                county's loudest accordion!" "Children must be kept on a leash at all times!"
                You know, that sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Overall, some excellent
                attention to detail.
                &lt;strong&gt;92%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Bar&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;

                alt="Rapture 3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To the layman, this looks fine, but the
                cracks are beginning to show. Some of it's correct: the drip trays, the
                special's board, the yard glass, and especially the ashtray. The stubs and ash
                are a nice touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But look at those taps! Finkelstein is not
                the name of an ale. Ales have names like Bishop's Bottom, Bulldog Scrotum and
                Rumpy Pumpy. The sort of names where you're not sure why anyone thought that
                would be something you'd want to put in your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Worse
                still, all six pumps are serving the same ale. That's not how these things are
                done. If you're running a village pub, you need one local ale, one bitter, and
                one speciality strong ale so the locals can order a half when they're feeling a
                bit adventurous. Optionally, you can also have an empty pump. This is a
                permanent reminder of the time the landlord wanted to feature a rotating
                selection of guest ales like what a pub in a town would have. It didn't work. As
                a final twist of the knife, tourists will regularly ask what's in the
                pump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As for snacks, there are none. No crisps, no Frazzles,
                no suspicious looking packs of pork scratchings with a font that suggests
                they've been in storage since the '60s. Perhaps you assume people don't actually
                eat those, but no. I've seen things. I once had a regular who always ordered a
                packet of salt and vinegar crisps and a pickled egg. He'd open the crisps, plop
                in the egg, and just go to town on the whole woeful affair. This is what happens
                in the countryside. It's harrowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's all a bit of a let
                down.
                &lt;strong&gt;30%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Decor&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                &lt;img
                data-fullimage-src="http://4d663a369f9f03c3c61e-870e77779efd63f7bd6c2ee08d8cfae6.r2.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/KlD2Pr6MS3yK.png"

                alt="Rapture 4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mostly good, if a bit bland. That's not a
                criticism of The Chinese Room, but of a particular, very safe variant of village
                pub style. This makes sense given many of the people you hear from throughout
                the game. These are not a people that would respond to anything too showy. A few
                maps and some nice landscapes are about as adventurous as they're going to
                get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can get a good flavour of a pub's life through its
                decor. When my dad ran a pub in the '90s, he filled it with trinkets from the
                local community. On a shelf behind the bar was a small, green plastic elephant.
                It belonged to a local called Sedge&amp;mdash;the sort of person who's had a
                nickname for so long that nobody knows what he's actually called. Whenever he
                had a pint, he'd drop the elephant into it. It was called the Sedgephant. This
                is not a good anecdote, but it is the sort of thing that happens in
                pubs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Er, by which I mean
                &lt;strong&gt;76%&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Furniture&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                &lt;img
                data-fullimage-src="http://0cb8dd5d2dc142d08f0f-eb3b436d25971e5860b39e72b0600342.r94.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/eaVLosAOSzqi.png"

                alt="Rapture 5" style="background-color: initial;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I
                can't fault the seating&amp;mdash;those round-backed wooden chairs and floral
                pattern benches are spot on. I do, however, worry where The Guy In The Corner
                will sit. The Guy In The Corner is your prime local&amp;mdash;more furniture
                than customer. He's inevitably the quietest person at the bar, uttering two or
                three incomprehensible sentences each night. It's not clear if he has a job, but
                he has enough money to be there every night. He has a seat, and it's located at
                the corner of the bar. It's his seat. You're not sure what would happen if
                anyone else sat there. Nobody ever does. He is called Bob, or Cedric, or
                Roland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In&amp;nbsp;The Stars At Night, his natural seat is
                directly&amp;nbsp;next to a table. Bob, or Cedric, or Roland won't like
                that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moving on, check out the placement of the dart board.
                It is in the most disruptive location. I'm not even sure there's enough space
                for a regulation oche. League night is almost certainly the worst night of the
                week, because outsiders are bussed in to stand around in a huge semi-circle that
                engulfs the room. People do not come to this pub on league night, for fear of
                being lost in a sea of barely contained beer gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe
                there's a point to this. Everybody's Gone to the&amp;nbsp;Rapture's fiction is
                wider&amp;nbsp;than its central mystery. Yaughton is, for all its detail, a
                fantasy. It's safe and sanitised, its personal dramas easily explained. If
                Everybody's Gone to the&amp;nbsp;Rapture says anything about the English
                countryside, it's about the version of it people want to exist. Villages, like
                anywhere, are full of problems, frustrations and stark, ugly realities. Pubs are
                buildings in which people go willingly to eat pickled eggs, listen to folk
                music, and drink pint after pint without saying a word. These are the quiet,
                subtle tragedies&amp;nbsp;that can't be neatly&amp;nbsp;resolved across a few
                audio snippets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also, look at these
                barrels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;img
                data-fullimage-src="http://36646d87786feafc0611-0338bbbce19fc98919c6293def4c5554.r0.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/mA3EODohQryj.png"

                alt="Rapture 6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those are lager barrels, not ale.
                &lt;strong&gt;50%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Verdict&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                I once had to sit behind a bar for hours while a local talked at length about
                the minutia of Cumbrian fishing bylaws.
                &lt;strong&gt;70%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                alt="March of the Living"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zombies zombies zombies. For
                years people have moaned&amp;nbsp;that zombie media has reached saturation
                point, but I'm not sure that will ever be true. One zombie game dies, and
                another inevitably rises to take its place.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
                href="http://www.marchofthelivinggame.com/" target="_blank"&gt;March of the
                Living&lt;/a&gt; is the latest, and while it sounds like a particularly grim
                March of the Penguins sequel, it's actually an FTL-inspired roguelite where you
                guide a group of survivors to &lt;del&gt;safety&lt;/del&gt;&amp;nbsp;their
                horrible deaths. It's out now, and&amp;nbsp;you can grab it&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
                href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/458000/" target="_blank"&gt;from Steam
                here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe width="854" height="480"
                src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3xEY4tWW-lw" frameborder="0"
                allowfullscreen=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's procedurally generated, of
                course, with "80,000 words of quality writing", and "over 160 unique events".
                The combat's real-time, but when you're not doing that you'll need to scavenge,
                trade, and do other things that zombocalypse survivors like
                to&amp;nbsp;do.&amp;nbsp;I said it was FTL-inspired, and developer Machine 22
                says as much in the marketing, but I'm reminded of the lovely&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
                href="http://www.hatsproductions.com/organtraildc/" target="_blank"&gt;Organ
                Trail&lt;/a&gt; too. (That was inspired by edutainment classic&amp;nbsp;The
                Oregon Trail, which also&amp;nbsp;inspired FTL. It's inspiration-inception up in
                here.)&amp;nbsp;Basically, zombies are a good fit for journey-based survival
                games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;March of the Living is out now, and if you buy it in
                the next few days you'll save 10%.&lt;/p&gt;

                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/the-elder-scrolls-online/" target="_blank"&gt;The
                Elder Scrolls Online's&lt;/a&gt; Dark Brotherhood guild, and it's definitely his
                name because &lt;em&gt;look at him&lt;/em&gt;. He wants your sneaky
                Khajit/magical Argonian/fighty human to do some murders for him, murders that
                will involve sneaking up on people and introducing daggers to their formerly
                rupture-free throats. (There will hopefully be other, more devious ways to
                assassinate people, as in the previous Elder Scrolls games, but the trailer
                doesn't show any such ways). Speaking of which, here's a new trailer offering a
                'first look' at TESO's upcoming Dark Brotherhood DLC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe

                particularly illuminating, as the latter&amp;nbsp;half of the trailer is taken
                up with a weird recap of the first, but hey ho. At least we know that the Dark
                Brotherhood is "coming soon" to TESO, and this is obviously Good News because
                the Dark&amp;nbsp;Brotherhood is ace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not as ace as the
                Thieves Guild, but still.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you have a favourite Elder
                Scrolls guild? The Fighters Guild is the wrong answer, obviously.&lt;/p&gt;

                great survival&amp;nbsp;sandbox mode, but if you've been playing since
                2014&amp;nbsp;then you might&amp;nbsp;have grown tired of
                &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;surviving. Thankfully&amp;nbsp;Hinterland has
                just&amp;nbsp;rolled out a major patch introducing challenge modes, as well as a
                few updates to the traditional game. Concerning the latter, among the most
                interesting developments is cabin fever. Yes, now you can go stir crazy if you
                stay indoors for too long, which raises the stakes quite a
                bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's tied to the new Rest system, which makes sleep a
                resource. You can only rest when you're statistically required to do so, but you
                can also "Pass Time", which advances the game's clock without any of the
                benefits proper rest will bring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We feel that these changes
                will go a long way towards keeping the game more interesting for long-term
                players, add another layer of strategic decision-making and resource management
                around where and when you Rest, and increase the challenge for those who’ve
                embraced long-term hibernation techniques," a studio spokesperson wrote in
                the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a

                notes&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other big addition is Challenge
                Modes, which add clear, morsel-sized objectives to the current sandbox mode. The
                video above has some footage of these, but the current patch introduces two in
                the form of "Hunted, Part One" and "Hopeless Rescue". There's a lot more to chew
                over, including major UI changes and a new radial menu system,&amp;nbsp;so you

                alt="Screen Shot 2016-04-21 at 11.02.36 am"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sega's Mega
                Drive catalogue (or Genesis catalogue, if you're in North America)
                has&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://store.steampowered.com/sub/7827/"&gt;been on
                Steam&lt;/a&gt; for a while, but according to an&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
                href="http://www.sega.co.uk/news/sega-mega-drive-classics-hub"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt;
                today it's getting a revamp – with Steam Workshop support. The Sega Mega Drive
                Classics Hub is a container app that provides access to all the Mega Drive games
                you own on Steam. It's basically a simulation of an early '90s bedroom
                and,&amp;nbsp;as the video below demonstrates, it's just a fancy&amp;nbsp;way to
                access the games themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hub will be free to anyone
                who already owns a Mega Drive game on Steam, and launches on April
                28.&amp;nbsp;More interesting is that the hub will usher in Steam Workshop
                support for all Mega Drive classics, which, in Sega's own words, allows users
                "to share modified versions of your favourite retro SEGA
                titles".&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement doesn't elaborate on any
                Workshop-related features, but it's good news for anyone who likes to tweak old
                games, and especially for those who want to revisit them in a new light. The hub
                also introduces local co-op support for relevant titles, optional graphical
                enhancements and full controller and keyboard support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's
                pretty cool, but despite the hub footage below looking a neat fit for VR, no
                such support has been confirmed as yet. It's probably only a matter of time,
                though. For a full list of supported games, check out Sega's&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
                href="http://www.sega.co.uk/news/sega-mega-drive-classics-hub"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt;,
                but it's safe to say that if you own an old Mega Drive game on Steam, it'll be
                supported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe width="853" height="480"

                Lost&lt;/a&gt; Incursion introduced at least one major exploit, which turns the
                mission's high level&amp;nbsp;item&amp;nbsp;drip feed into a veritable
                hailstorm. Ubisoft Massive is working on a fix, and is currently figuring out
                how to punish those who have exploited the
                glitch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It looks like the studio has another problem
                on its hands though, and this one could arguably be bigger: a player has found a
                way to increase their weapon damage enormously. As the video below by
                YouTuber&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5xe2IqV6AJWTqsOWJT_u8A"&gt;Simplified&lt;/a&gt;
                demonstrates, it's possible to one-shot high level enemies using the exploit.
                Imagine the kind of damage you could do in the Dark Zone with
                this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I won't&amp;nbsp;spell out how to use the exploit – I
                don't wanna ruin anyone's fun – but the trick is pretty simple and it's in the
                video description. To get an idea of how powerful it is, check out the video
                below. It's safe to say that when Ubisoft decides how it will&amp;nbsp;&lt;a

                exploiters&lt;/a&gt;, those using this one will be first against the
                wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe width="853" height="480"

                alt="Dark Souls Comic 01"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You’d expect &lt;a
                href="http://www.comicbookresources.com/comic-previews/dark-souls-1-titan-comics-2016"&gt;the
                Dark Souls comic&lt;/a&gt;, which released April 20th from Titan Comics (story
                by George Mann and art by Alan Quah), to be a series of washed out, sad monsters
                and silent knights postured among intricate weather-worn medieval architecture.
                But after reading the first issue, I’m taken by surprise: the panels are
                detailed and colorful, the characters are chatty, and the plot is far from
                convoluted. It doesn’t adhere to subtler methods and isn’t necessarily worse for
                it, but tonally, the comic feels out of touch with the restrained nature of the
                games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Our adventure begins with Fira, a knight who sets out
                to find a way to save the kingdom of Ishra from descending into an age of
                darkness. There’s a dangerous cave, the curse of the Undead, ancient knights,
                and dragons involved. Sound familiar? It’s the same basic plot from every Dark
                Souls game, but set in a different time and place. The series is all about the
                repetition of cycles and how people interpret light and dark in spiritual and
                moralistic ways as their particular doomsday approaches. I’m curious to see
                Ishra carve out its own identity and I hope Fira’s story puts a unique spin on a
                plot we’ve seen three times so far, but even after the first issue it’s hard to
                see where everything is headed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The whole of her first issue
                adventure feels like the sequence in a movie before the opening credits:
                intriguing and action-packed, but low on characterization. We only know that
                Fira left her distressed people to seek a different means for their salvation,
                but by the end, all we know is that she’s juggling the guilt of leaving with her
                long term intentions. Whether or not Fira resolves that guilt and accomplishes
                her goal (and at what cost) remains to be seen, but since the comic starts in
                the middle of her adventure, I found little reason to care about her problems
                beyond her supposed ties to a few familiar Dark Souls
                characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fira is accompanied by a scryer named Aldrich, a
                notable name to players of Dark Souls 3. Enough hints are dropped to safely
                assume that this Aldrich is the same Lord of Cinder who, upon consuming too many
                men, transformed into a sentient puddle of goo. But in the comic, he’s a solid
                human person with hazy motives. His character bio says that he saw Ishra’s
                redemption in a prophecy of “dirt and fire and blood and bone” which led him to
                team up with Fira. Whether or not his intent is to help Ishra or to use her for
                some nefarious means is unclear, but it’s the biggest hook the comic set by a
                long shot, even if his inclusion is troubling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;img
                data-fullimage-src="http://0cb8dd5d2dc142d08f0f-eb3b436d25971e5860b39e72b0600342.r94.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/Wl05qOJ_QZqv.PNG"
                src="http://4d663a369f9f03c3c61e-870e77779efd63f7bd6c2ee08d8cfae6.r2.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/I6Yw4d7uljg5.878x0.Z-Z96KYq.jpg"
                alt="Dark Souls Comic 02"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I’m excited to see such an
                important character explored in detail, and my hopes are that the series covers
                his descent into cannibalism, maybe his appointment as a Lord of Cinder. It’s
                rare to have outright answers in a Souls game–but, the mystery of Dark Souls’
                lore is key to its intrigue. Without an endless stream of questions, so goes my
                investment, especially if Aldrich’s characterization is flat. I have an existing
                idea of who Aldrich was based on the information peppered throughout Dark Souls
                3, and I’m worried that meeting the expectations of my imagination will be
                impossible, like falling in love with a novel and then reading the casting news
                for the movie adaptation. (Tom Cruise as Aldrich? What were you thinking,
                Michael Bay?) And based on my impressions of the writing and art, I’m not
                exactly hopeful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Graphic
                detail&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dark Souls characters don’t say much,
                and with good reason. Swerving into melodrama is easy in such a bleak world
                composed of familiar medieval imagery, so when the dialogue is deployed, it’s
                meant to hit hard&amp;mdash;most often as a sad, insightful elegy for the world
                and its inhabitants, and rarely as casual conversation. Which is why the
                constant talk between Fira and Aldrich lack the levity I’m accustomed to. The
                writing humanizes them, but simultaneously slips into a swashbuckling Dungeons
                and Dragons tone from time to time. Instead of a quiet battle with an impossible
                foe, the comic climaxes with a chatty finale; two combatants discussing hits and
                expository one-liners in equal measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; There’s very
                little mystery to its strong lines and bold colors, even if there’s plenty to
                admire. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; The art in Dark Souls speaks for itself
                instead of relying on text-heavy bouts of storytelling to explain it away. In
                the comic, the opposite is true. I don’t think the art is poor, but I’m not
                entirely sure why Quah chose to represent Dark Souls’ bizarre dreamlike fantasy
                world in such a traditional way. There’s very little mystery to its strong lines
                and bold colors, even if there’s plenty to admire.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sandman_(Vertigo)"
                target="_blank"&gt;The Sandman series&lt;/a&gt; from Vertigo or&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkham_Asylum:_A_Serious_House_on_Serious_Earth"
                target="_blank"&gt;Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth&lt;/a&gt;
                both come to mind; the former maintains a good balance of grounded scenes and
                experimental collages that illustrate the dreamier sequences, while Asylum uses
                black space to convey the mystery and tightness of its dark
                corridors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nearly every environment in a Dark Souls game can
                be studied and dissected for its narrative meaning. The comic is mostly a series
                of bland crystalline backgrounds that don’t serve much purpose beyond
                disorienting the reader. That said, the intent may be to keep it straight and
                clean for the first issue, then to mirror the series’ slow descent into wonder
                and awe by experimenting with style as the issues release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                Knowing who’s who and what’s what is strange for Dark Souls, but if the story
                Mann is setting up can stay interesting on its own while tying into the greater
                Dark Souls lore in a meaningful way, then I’ll keep reading. I just hope they
                take bolder steps in their attempts to capture the slow-drip horror and sublime
                beauty that the games owe their successes to.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

                width="610"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two days ago, we learned about &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/john-romero-is-teasing-a-new-shooter/"&gt;Hoxar
                Inc&lt;/a&gt;, a purported tech start-up that in reality is linked somehow to a
                new FPS being developed by Romero Games, an indie studio founded by Doom and
                Quake co-creator John Romero. Today, Romero let slip another, more overt tease,
                featuring an appearance by fellow famous name from the Doom
                days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Adrian Carmack&amp;mdash;no relation to
                John&amp;mdash;was one of the four co-founders of id Software, where he worked
                as lead artist. He left the studio in 2005 (he later claimed in a lawsuit that
                he'd been forced out) and has had effectively nothing to do with the industry
                since, which is what makes his potential return so interesting. Call it
                nostalgia if you like (and okay, fine, it is), but this kind of “getting the
                band back together” stuff&amp;nbsp;is absolutely up my alley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                The &lt;a href="http://www.nightworkgames.com/"&gt;Nightworkgames.com&lt;/a&gt;
                website linked in the video doesn't reveal much about what's going on, except
                that “a new First-Person Shooter is being built at Night Work Games Ltd. in
                Galway, Ireland,” and that the studio itself “is the dark and violent subsidiary
                of Romero Games Ltd.” It's not even certain that this is related to the Hoxar
                thing, although separate teases for separate projects in this kind of proximity
                seems awfully unlikely to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All will be revealed,
                apparently, on April 25. If I hear something ahead of that, I'll let you
                know.&lt;/p&gt;

                alt="Job Simulator 3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's been all of two weeks since
                &lt;a href="http://www.pcgamer.com/job-simulator/"&gt;Job Simulator&lt;/a&gt;, a
                game which despite its wholly unappealing title is actually &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/job-simulator-2/"&gt;pretty good&lt;/a&gt;, debuted
                on Steam. That short span of time makes the recent announcement of a permanent,
                25 percent &lt;a
                href="http://steamcommunity.com/games/448280/announcements/detail/887582885482635746"&gt;price
                drop&lt;/a&gt; seem more than a little odd. The reason for the cut is a bit
                unusual too, but it's a good one: “This will allow even more people to
                experience the mind blowing moment when you realize your hands can truly work in
                VR&amp;mdash;and then be used to throw a stapler at your
                boss.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game was expensive to make, developer Owlchemy Labs
                explained, because of the size of the team and the length of the development
                period&amp;mdash;15 people working for a year and a half&amp;mdash;and the fact
                that it was built from the ground-up for VR, which the studio said is a “much
                more intensive process” than conventional game development. Based on that, and
                "the culmination of our thoughts on the VR market at launch,” the price was
                initially set at $40. “With the launch of a brand new platform, no one quite
                knew what to expect, so we had to use whatever metrics we had available to
                us."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We knew that the initial market for VR would
                be something that would grow over time, but as it takes a long time to get this
                brand spanking new hardware into consumers hands, we knew it would be a slow
                start," the studio said. "In order to recoup our costs for the smaller audience,
                we placed what we believed to be a competitive, but fair, price on the
                game."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while the Steam user reviews are “very positive,” a
                number of comments in the “&lt;a
                href="http://steamcommunity.com/app/448280/discussions/2/"&gt;Pricing
                Discussion&lt;/a&gt;” forum are less than enthusiastic about the
                expense&amp;mdash;enough to prompt the reduction. “The point of Job Simulator
                was always to share the joy of VR with as many people as we could convince to
                put their hands (both gloved or un-gloved) on it! So we’re lowering the price,”
                Owlchemy said. “The community has been sincere and honest with their feedback,
                and so we’re responding.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Job Simulator is one of two games
                that come &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/the-htc-vive-will-cost-799/"&gt;bundled with the
                HTC Vive&lt;/a&gt; headset, which may have helped facilitate the change, but for
                those looking to buy it separately, it now carries a permanent $30/£23 price tag
                &lt;a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/448280"&gt;on Steam&lt;/a&gt;.
                Anyone who purchased the game at the original price has until April 26 to &lt;a
                href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=6695-QIKM-7966"&gt;claim
                a refund&lt;/a&gt;, regardless of how many hours are into it, and then
                (presumably) re-purchase it at the lower cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks, &lt;a

                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/rocket-league"&gt;Rocket League&lt;/a&gt;, the game
                that blends colossal soccer with physics-defying automobiles,&amp;nbsp;will soon
                give players the option to hit the court and shoot some hoops instead. Developer
                Psyonix &lt;a
                href="http://steamcommunity.com/games/252950/announcements/detail/699557703461742353"&gt;announced
                today&lt;/a&gt; that the b-ball-inspired Hoops Mode will be added to the game,
                for free, on April 26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spiritually similar to the
                hockey-themed &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/rocket-league-hockey-themed-snow-day-mode-dated/"&gt;Snow
                Day&lt;/a&gt; update that came out last year, Hoops Mode will be accompanied by
                a new “Dunk House” arena, which like the new game mode will be given to all
                players at no cost. Those of you determined to throw money at it will be able to
                pick up an officially-licensed NBA Flag Pack, which will cost $2 and contain the
                logos of all 30 NBA teams. All players will be given one NBA logo flag for free
                when they update the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The announcement is light on
                details, but the trailer gives a pretty good idea of what's in store: Goliath
                basketball, in cars, with little regard for the laws of gravity. Shots obviously
                won't need to be as precise as they are in real hoops, but the elevated,
                horizontal net will be a big change from the usual “aim-and-fire” across a flat
                plane. Psyonix said more information about the update will be released
                throughout the week.&lt;/p&gt;

                allowfullscreen=""&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt; I am a lobster, and my life is
                simple. I hunt sardines, seek shelter from tuna, breed as many offspring as I
                can and destroy submarines with homing missiles&amp;hellip; wait, what? I'm
                pretty sure arthropods don't have intelligent projectiles. &lt;a
                href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/450500/"&gt;Ace of Seafood&lt;/a&gt; is
                about as unassuming as games come, but it hides an alluring adventure about
                rearing squadrons of fishy warriors&amp;nbsp;and conquering the
                deep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When you first take the helm of your school of
                fish&amp;mdash;you can select sardines, salmon, or spiny lobsters as your
                starter&amp;mdash;you're welcomed by a chill, down-tempo electro track that
                would have been at home in a late ‘00s cocktail lounge. From there you have a
                short tutorial and that's it. You're left to probe the ocean's waters and build
                the biggest, baddest pack of aquatic creatures you can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I
                started my run with a pair of lobsters, rightly assuming that their carapace
                would make my posse a bit hardier. I tacked north and east first, searching for
                natural or man-made reefs. These act as safe havens and save points. Most come
                with a tough, boss-esque school of fish that guard the checkpoints. From
                barracuda to cubera snapper, I had a stunning variety of marine life to battle,
                and later recruit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Depending upon which fish you're currently
                controlling, Ace of Seafood plays like an awkward hybrid of a submarine sim and
                an Armored Core knock-off. You'll have a variety of attacks and formations you
                can choose for your school as well as some precision aiming options for those
                wanting to keep their distance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img
                data-fullimage-src="http://0cb8dd5d2dc142d08f0f-eb3b436d25971e5860b39e72b0600342.r94.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/Df_QiUUNQcq6.jpg"

                alt="Aceofseafood1" class=""&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;The spiny lobster, armed with
                unseen laser batteries.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt; As I turned
                my foes to chum, I collected their genetic material. After a point (usually
                three or four specimens) I could start breeding those creatures myself, adding
                their abilities to mine. Odd as it sounds, when I came across submarines and
                battlecruisers later in the game, I learned that I could kill them and collect
                their genes as well. While it made absolutely no sense, it let me run a solid
                mix of battle-ready animals and war machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I felt
                like Star Trek's Borg, eager to add my foes' biological and technological
                distinctiveness to my own.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My twin lobsters saw
                vampire squid, great white sharks and even dreadnoughts join their ranks before
                long. Battles against larger opponents were, tougher, but I was Inspired to
                press on. I felt like Star Trek's Borg, eager to add my foes' biological and
                technological distinctiveness to my own. It's an effective system that kept me
                looking to win out-leveled fights so that I could skip a few stages of the game.
                But that's also where Ace of Seafood starts bumping into some
                problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of the sea creatures you can play has their own
                set of abilities, and they all feel quite a bit distinct from one another.
                Vampire squid are best in swarms where they can launch volleys of laser-spines
                at encroaching predators, for example. But Ace of Seafood is a fiddly beast to
                control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started with an Xbox One controller. I tend to
                prefer gamepads for expansive RPGs and thought it'd make a good fit here. But it
                was almost unplayable without a mouse. It would select some menu options by
                default and refuse to accept controller input. Switching completely to a KB + M
                only solved some of my problems, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img
                data-fullimage-src="http://0cb8dd5d2dc142d08f0f-eb3b436d25971e5860b39e72b0600342.r94.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/vuh6OlhXSvid.jpg"

                alt="Aceofseafood7" class=""&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The UI is absolutely nuts,
                adding to the over-the-top premise.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                Even under the best circumstances my lobsters' movements were jittery and
                spotty, often forcing me into the line of enemy fire. Aiming well was tough, and
                companion pathfinding AI was terrible. I often marched into a bout expecting my
                friends would be right behind me, only to be torn limb from limb as I struggled
                to fight alone. Because of that, I got into the habit of camping near new reefs
                or large sea monsters and wait for my crew to arrive before unleashing my
                salvos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was good fun, and so far as I could tell,
                arranging my fishy pals in squads and planning my approach yielded better
                results. As often as this game looks like swarms of spammy lasers and missiles,
                I did well when I put some thought into it. And, after a point, that became
                essential. The biggest monsters of the deep would wipe out my starters and even
                many of the tougher creatures I'd found in one or two hits. In response, I
                started coordinating my attacks. I'd put myself in the tankiest creature I
                could, and would keep a few faster creatures on hand to support my
                assault.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="gfyitem" alt="HomelyAnimatedAbalone
                (gfyCat video) " data-id="HomelyAnimatedAbalone" data-controls="false"
                data-title="false" data-autoplay="true"
                data-expand="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All of this is unusual, for sure, but
                somewhat normal. If you can buy into the premise of a tank simulator with fish
                in place of mobile armor, then you've got a good idea of what to expect. As the
                game progresses though, I got progressively creepy blurbs at loading screens.
                Phrases like "Physical DNA has been destroyed by gamma rays" and "People once
                dreamed of their bodies shining and emitting light. Their dreams became a
                reality" lend an unnerving atmosphere to these violent seas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                Before long, Ace of Seafood started tilting into the meta-realm. It suggested
                that I was in a simulation or controlling the only life forms left on Earth, and
                that my help would be crucial in "the new world." With that, my dogged pursuit
                of power and assimilation started to feel morbid and uncomfortable, silly as the
                notion of fish and crustaceans firing torpedoes and lasers
                was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite the weird shift in tone and how frustrating the
                unreliable controls were, I couldn't stop playing. I dumped seven hours into the
                game before I knew I was still awake at 4 a.m. Once I started probing the dark
                abyss, I just wanted to continue exploring. I wanted to see what alien monsters
                lurked near the sea floor. So if you've got&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
                href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/450500/"&gt;$12&lt;/a&gt; and are
                curious about what it's like to pit sharks against warships, Ace of Seafood is
                your game.&lt;/p&gt;

                great back-to-back finals.</description>

                alt="LoL Warden Sivir"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’s been a big week for League of
                Legends. The developers released their second Riot Pls post, where they tackled
                the hot topics of sandbox mode, solo queue, and the future. The discussion died
                down just in time for the two LCS finals on opposite sides of the ocean: North
                America hosted the historic rivalry of Team SoloMid vs Counter Logic Gaming, and
                Europe bore witness to G2 Esports v Origen. In a way, these two events
                represented the absolute highs and lows of Riot Games, League, and how fans
                react to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Riot pls&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first &lt;a
                href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/riot-games/announcements/riot-pls"&gt;Riot
                Pls&lt;/a&gt;, published in August of 2015, dropped two bombshells on fans:
                First, their tech debt was so immense that replays, promoted during the game’s
                &lt;em&gt;launch&lt;/em&gt; in 2009, weren’t on the cards. While no one was
                pleased to hear this, you can’t argue with technical limitations. The second
                letdown was Riot’s announcement that they weren’t working on a Sandbox Mode,
                and, in fact, &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; not be working on a Sandbox Mode. &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/riots-sandbox-stance-is-inarticulate-and-harmful/"&gt;James
                Chen penned an articulate piece&lt;/a&gt; at the time about why this was
                terrible for new players, pro players, and everyone
                in&amp;nbsp;between.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You might think that when the &lt;a
                href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/riot-games/announcements/riot-pls-dynamic-queue-sandbox-and-league-2016"&gt;second
                Riot Pls&lt;/a&gt; feature went live, players would celebrate. Riot admitted
                that player feedback had swayed them, and they had changed their mind
                accordingly. Great, right? Well, no. This time, players were furious that Solo
                Queue is being discarded in favor of the new Dynamic Queue
                system.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Riot Pls pieces are a fascinating
                experiment in public relations. They’re clearly either earnestly penned and
                articulated, or so carefully calculated in order to come across that way, that
                your initial impression might be that they’d be a hit. The new trend of
                developers listening to player feedback and working accordingly has always been
                greeted with triumph&amp;mdash;we did it, Reddit! And yet the response to the
                Riot Pls posts has been unrelentingly negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So what’s
                going on? Part of it is no doubt that players don’t like receiving bad news,
                even if it's delivered in a very careful way. Part of it is that Riot is trying
                so hard to make these posts accessible and friendly that it’s, ironically,
                leading to the opposite effect. Players are reacting like Riot are spinning a
                chair around and asking them if they want to “rap”. Even the title is a
                community meme!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Are the Riot Pls pieces a complete disaster?
                I don’t think so&amp;mdash;it’s refreshing to see a company say they were
                straight out wrong. They’re valuable glimpses at the road map for the months to
                come. They provide a forum for players to offer feedback. So what can be
                improved?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-left: 20px;"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Talk is
                cheap:&lt;/strong&gt; Riot just penned over a thousand words, and while there
                are promises there, there’s not much in the way of concrete information or
                timelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-left: 20px;"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Thinking
                too far ahead:&lt;/strong&gt; When they say League of Legends is a game that
                they want to last for generations, that is a massively ambitious goal that comes
                across as a little foolhardy. Maybe our grandchildren will be playing League,
                but there’s little sense in announcing such a far reaching goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p
                style="margin-left: 20px;"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Give us something
                solid:&lt;/strong&gt; Riot has been burned when announcing timelines before (a
                moment of silence for Ao Shin), but giving players absolutely no information
                beyond intent makes their statements look like fluff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The
                controversy died down eventually&amp;mdash;there were finals to watch, after
                all, and these were some of the most compelling ones
                yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img

                Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Crowning the
                champions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; Each final was played back to back on Saturday,
                for a total of nine matches across Rotterdam and Vegas. First up was Europe,
                hosting G2 Esports up against Origen. G2 Esports is a classic new kid on the
                block story: the squad fought their way through the Promotion Tournament (unlike
                teams like Vitality or the Immortals, who purchased their spot), earned an
                impressive 15-3 record across the regular split, and picked up
                accolades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sure, three of the
                team&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;aren’t&lt;/em&gt; rookies, and they have the backing of
                Carlos "ocelote" Rodríguez Santiago and Joey "YoungBuck" Steltenpool. But they
                didn’t enter the LCS with a star studded roster&amp;mdash;instead they had two
                rookies, an import who had subbed for CJ Entus, a jungler who swapped to mid
                lane, and an older ADC who had struggled to find a team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not
                only did they silence any doubters with their first season, but they took the
                entire Split. Origen’s six-man roster had the win on paper: a squad of veterans
                who had made the semis in last year’s Worlds, an extra mid laner, the infamous
                Origen playoffs buff... but it simply wasn’t enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Happily
                enough, Origen are content with their split, with top laner Paul “SoaZ” Boyer
                tweeting that he was feeling renewed and ready to fight to go to
                Worlds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Over in NA, it’s hard to say anything new about the
                CLG and TSM rivalry. They’re two of the oldest organizations in the region,
                they’ve fought tooth and nail for ages, and Doublelift infamously tossed his CLG
                jersey in the trash to switch over to TSM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The real story of
                the NA playoffs is centered around the two rookies, Trevor “Stixxay” Hayes and
                Choi "Huhi" Jae-hyun. Both of these players were considered downgrades from
                their predecessors, drawbacks, and disappointments all split long. The
                management and veterans of Counter Logic Gaming backed them the entire way, and
                their second Split victory in a row is a clear statement: we were right, you
                were wrong, and we’re the best in the region. Their next test will be competing
                internationally, and while the odds are stacked against them, their team based
                approach may just be what helps them advance past the benchmark set by their
                Western competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As we head into a new week of League,
                it’s clear that neither the matters arising from Riot Pls or NA LoL have been
                truly laid to rest. Fans are going to continue to push for Solo Queue, as they
                did for Sandbox Mode. The rivalry between TSM and CLG is more alive than ever,
                only growing more intense in the aftermath of CLG’s skin-of-their-teeth victory.

                width="610"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt; Creative Assembly has announced that the
                colorful human kingdom of Bretonnia will be a playable faction in custom and
                multplayer battles in the upcoming dark fantasy strategy game &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/total-war-warhammer/"&gt;Total War:
                Warhammer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Bretonnians rely heavily on powerful
                armored units and overwhelming charges in battles, the studio said, backed by
                heavy trebuchet artillery and masses of archers. Think medieval France,
                essentially.&amp;nbsp;They don't bring much to the table in the way of
                massive&amp;nbsp;monsters, but their Enchantresses can unleash powerful
                offensive magic as well as buffs that greatly fortify the abilities of their
                knights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Interestingly, it was almost exactly one year ago
                that we mentioned the absence of the Bretonnians, who “seem to have fallen out
                of favor with Games Workshop these days,” in our breakdown of the &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/total-war-warhammerthe-factions-the-units-the-heroes/"&gt;Total
                War: Warhammer factions&lt;/a&gt;. They haven't been totally absent from the
                action, however: They're also a playable faction in the fantasy sports sim &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/behold-the-brawling-bretonnians-in-new-blood-bowl-2-trailer/"&gt;Blood
                Bowl 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To demonstrate how the Bretonnians will
                play, Creative Assembly posted a 25-minute gameplay video pitting them against a
                Vampiric invasion of the city of Couronne. I won't tell you who wins, but it
                looks pretty fantastic. Total War: Warhammer comes out on May 24.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt; As promised, Blizzard has detailed the Basic and Classic Hearthstone
                &lt;a
                href="http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/blog/20097355/keeping-hearthstone-fresh-4-20-2016"&gt;cards
                which it will be re-balancing&lt;/a&gt; ahead of the arrival of the game’s new
                &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/hearthstones-new-format-will-see-old-expansions-retired-from-standard-play/"&gt;Standard
                mode&lt;/a&gt; next week, with explanations for why each change is being made
                from senior designer Mike Donais.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In total, 12
                cards have been nerfed, with Druid hit hardest in the form of changes to three
                of its staple cards in Ancient of Lore, Keeper of the Grove and&amp;mdash;no
                doubt to the delight of everyone who has grown sick of being smacked in the face
                by angry trees&amp;mdash;Force of Nature. You can see all the cards being

                alt="Hearthstone nerfs Master of Disguise"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aside from
                neutering the &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/does-hearthstones-druid-combo-need-to-be-nerfed/"&gt;Druid
                combo&lt;/a&gt;, other commonly predicted nerfs include the neutral “tech” cards
                Big Game Hunter and Ironbeak Owl, which have both been accused of being
                fun-ruiners because they respectively counter high attack minions or those with
                powerful card text effects. Both have had their mana costs increased in a bid to
                reduce their utility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aggro decks also take a slight hit,
                with stat reductions for Leper Gnome and Knife Juggler. In the case of the
                latter, I suspect it won’t be enough to stop it seeing played. The same can’t be
                said for Arcane Golem, which, as with the Druid’s Treants, has lost the charge
                effect, effectively rendering it unplayable. No surprise there, as Blizzard has
                long struggled to stop cheap Charge minions from being abused in obnoxious
                combos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Far more surprising is the change to Blade Flurry,
                the Rogue AoE spell. It now costs more and no longer does damage to the opposing
                hero’s face. Again, the aim is to reduce giant burst combos. We’ll have more
                detailed analysis of the changes from our resident expert Simon “Sottle” Welch
                soon, but it’s interesting to note that when we asked Andrey “Reynad” Yanyuk to
                &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/reynad-on-the-10-old-cards-blizzard-should-nerf-for-hearthstone-standard/"&gt;predict
                10 cards&lt;/a&gt; that would be nerfed, he called 5 of the ones that did get
                changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps the most notable absence in the cards
                Blizzard picked to re-work is anything from the Freeze Mage archetype. Aggro
                Shaman also looks disgustingly&amp;nbsp;powerful going into Standard, with Leper
                Gnome the only card altered, and powerful
                defensive&amp;nbsp;tools&amp;nbsp;from&amp;nbsp;the Curse of Naxxramas and
                Goblins vs Gnomes sets, such as Sludge Belcher and Healbot,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/the-20-most-important-cards-that-will-be-removed-from-hearthstone-standard/"&gt;due&amp;nbsp;to
                cycle out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These changes will come into effect as
                part of patch 5.0, the arrival of which will coincide with the launch of the
                Whispers Of The Old Gods expansion on April 26th. As ever, you’ll be able to
                disenchant changed cards for their full dust value for a limited period of time
                afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Let me know in the comments if you’re happy (it
                being the internet, almost certainly not) with the nerfs. Which cards do you
                think escaped unfairly? Should any of the &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/hearthstone-the-20-best-legendary-cards/"&gt;powerful
                legendaries&lt;/a&gt; like Alexstraza have been hit? Overall I’m as excited by
                the nerfs as I am the new cards, because so many of these cards had become
                auto-includes, or, like Master of Disguise, prevented other cool cards from
                being created. And, whisper it, but as a &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/becoming-a-golden-druid-a-tale-of-obsession/"&gt;Druid
                main&lt;/a&gt;, I think we’ve actually got off kinda
                lightly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;img class="pulled-image pull-left"

                alt="Fallout 4 ghoul"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest beta update to &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/fallout-4"&gt;Fallout 4&lt;/a&gt; is now live on
                Steam, bringing a “revamped” Survivor Mode to the game based on feedback
                received on the previous update. Before you leap into it with both feet,
                however, be aware that mod compatibility isn't all there, and Bethesda said “we
                strongly advise players running third-party mod managers to back up saves and
                disable/uninstall them before opting into the beta.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We had a
                look at an earlier version of Survival Mode &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/toughing-it-out-in-out-fallout-4s-survival-mode/"&gt;a
                few weeks ago&lt;/a&gt;, but the short version is that it makes the game a whole
                lot tougher, with “additional challenges including no fast travel, saving only
                when you sleep, increased lethality, diseases, fatigue, danger and more.” Two
                things of note: Characters at the Survival difficulty will appear under a
                separate character selection filter, and they will not be backward-compatible
                with the 1.4 version, so if you end up opting out of the beta for some reason,
                you will not be able to use them. A more detailed breakdown of the Survival Mode
                changes is available from the in-game help menu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The update
                will also make improvements to the third-person camera when players are up
                against walls or other objects, and fixes a relatively small handful of bugs.
                Creation Kit and Bethesda.net mod support are still in closed beta, but Bethesda
                said it hopes to get them into the Steam update soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because
                it's a beta update, you'll have to take a few extra steps to access it if you
                haven't already done so. Instructions are included with the &lt;a
                href="http://steamcommunity.com/games/377160/announcements/detail/883079388275607249"&gt;update
                announcement&lt;/a&gt;, but it's pretty simple stuff: Right-click Fallout 4 in
                your Steam library, select Settings, select Betas, then click on “Beta” in the
                drop-down menu. Wait for it to update, and you're ready to rock: You'll know
                you've done it properly when Fallout 4 appears as “Fallout 4 [Beta]” in your
                library.&lt;/p&gt;

                alt="Lian Li DK-04"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lian Li has been known to release some
                funky case designs, such as the oddly appealing snail shaped&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
                href="http://983ac1d5a4c0d90c33a5-6ed0f2ca3548d4cedef174af140e4e3c.r16.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/MCvZuUJR9a4O.840x0.Vdef9Kkm.jpg"&gt;PC-777
                Memorial Edition&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/lian-li-train-inspired-case-steams-into-view/"
                target="_blank"&gt;train inspired PC-CK101&lt;/a&gt;. With that kind of
                portfolio, it's no surprise that Lian Li is now the first to market with a
                standing desk chassis, the &lt;a
                href="http://www.lian-li.com/en/dt_portfolio/dk-04/"
                target="_blank"&gt;DK-04&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's right, the DK-04 is
                both a standing desk with motorized action &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a computer
                case. The idea behind the thing is that you'll stand up during work hours and
                then sit for a spell to play games. In that regard, the DK-04 might appeal most
                to anyone who works remotely, as the standing option will keep them off their
                rump during the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can adjust the desk anywhere from
                67.5 cm to 116 cm by pressing the up and down arrows on the front panel. There
                are&amp;nbsp;four presets that you can configure and the desk will automatically
                adjust to the height you input with the press of a
                button.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn't Lian Li's first stab at a standing desk.
                It's gone through &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/lian-li-reveal-bizarre-new-desktop-pc-design/"&gt;several
                iterations&lt;/a&gt;, with this latest version featuring a slimmer frame that
                tapers toward the user for better leg room. The legs are made from steel and can
                support loads of up to 100 kg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make building inside the
                desk easier, the DK-04 has a removable motherboard tray. Lian Li also made sure
                to leave ample elbow room inside the desk to help with piecing together a PC.
                You'll find anchored cable clips along the way to help with snaking cables in an
                organized fashion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DK-04 has eight expansion slots. It
                supports full size ATX and micro ATX motherboards, along with VGA cars up to
                320mm in length, CPU coolers up to 140mm tall, and ATX power supplies up to
                210mm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are four stacking drive racks with rubber
                insulation in the DK-04. That gives builders the ability to install a total of
                eight 2.5-inch or 3.5-inch drives with vibration dampeners. There's also a
                5.25-inch bay on the front panel for an optical drive, fan controller, or audio
                breakout box (or even a cup holder, if you can still find one in stock), along
                with four USB 3.0 ports, HD audio inputs, and slots for the RGB controller (for
                optional lighting).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To keep your components from frying
                themselves, Lian Li includes four 120 mm intake fans in the front of the chassis
                and four 120 mm exhaust fans in the back. If you prefer to liquid cool, you can
                swap the front fans for a 480mm radiator and the rear fans for two 240
                radiators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brushed aluminum finish gives the DK-04 classic
                styling that Lian Li is known for, and a tempered glass top panel lets you show
                off your setup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's &lt;a
                href="http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/03/17/470713717/stand-to-work-if-you-like-but-dont-brag-about-its-benefits"
                target="_blank"&gt;some debate&lt;/a&gt; as to whether using a standing desk can
                lead to better health than a sitting one. Either way, you'll pay a premium for
                the luxury of being able to stand up, at least in this case. The DK-04 will be
                available &lt;a
                href="https://www.globalpr.agency/press-room/lian-li/press-releases/article/worlds-first-standing-computer-desk-lian-lis-new-dk-04/"
                target="_blank"&gt;May 10 for $1,499&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

                data-fullimage-src="http://0cb8dd5d2dc142d08f0f-eb3b436d25971e5860b39e72b0600342.r94.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/Q9AYs3VcS3m6.jpg"

                alt="Dark Souls gesture 1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You meet all sorts
                of people on the battlements of Dark Souls&amp;nbsp;3. Impatient players,
                playful players, roleplayers who like to dress up as Dark Souls heroes and
                villains. Dress, weapon choice and fighting style all contribute to your
                image&amp;mdash;Souls fashion is serious business&amp;mdash;but it's the gesture
                system that gives you personality, and allows for mischievous banter. Without
                this language of posture and counter-posture the Kingdom of Lothric would be a
                gloomier place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a matter of etiquette. Do you bow when
                you meet an opponent in a duel? Which of the game's three bows do you choose?
                The official duelling bow, with a formal clasp of the hand to the chest, might
                be a little too reverent for some. The standard bow&amp;mdash;a mere
                nod&amp;mdash;might suggest a level of casual acknowledgement that doesn't give
                your opponent too much credit. But what if your opponent attacks as you pay
                respect? Such rudeness only makes victory sweeter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In
                cooperative scenarios gestures let players celebrate, commiserate and squabble.
                At the fog gate to one tough boss, I swapped a friendly wave with one co-op
                partner while another warped in and simply pointed towards the boss as though to
                say "let's get on with this". Gestures manage to communicate so much without
                sound, by necessity. It allows for a sparkle of humour without undermining the
                heavy sense of doom that pervades Lothric. Voice chat would be too brash and
                noisy, almost sacrilegious, like farting in the Bodleian
                Library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img
                data-fullimage-src="http://ec0c5a7f741a6f3bff65-dd07187202f57fa404a8f047da2bcff5.r85.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/8dt2DCXxT8O8.jpg"

                alt="Dark Souls gesture 3" style="background-color:
                initial;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gestures are accessed through their own menu,
                and in the beginning your choices are limited to a series of differently-angled
                points, a wave and a celebratory air-punch. As you meet NPCs your collection of
                emotes grows, and your character's emotional range grows with it. Forty hours
                ago I could merely point at things, now I can lie on the floor with my arms and
                legs spread out like a giant armoured toddler. I can collapse on the floor,
                defeated. I like my character more for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's more to the
                gesture system than player communication. Dark Souls is great at world building
                traditional RPG systems. Your inventory is both a stash and an expression of
                your amassed personhood. The cursed Darksign that lets you revive at a bonfire
                every time you die is a scar on your character's body, but you'll also find it
                as an object in your inventory, because in game logic terms your inventory,
                along with your stat sheet, is the sum of what you are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your
                gesture collection is part of this, and so forms an important part of your
                character's progression. Early on I met a knight who carries a boozy potion,
                brewed to his own recipe. After some jolly cooperation he gave me a flask and
                taught me how to toast. Many hours later, perched on the buttress of a huge
                forsaken cathedral, I toasted the stunning view and remembered my pal. In a
                small but meaningful way the gesture system let me carry his cheerful outlook
                with me. I collect little fragments of other characters' worldviews as I roam
                the world. It's a better expression of 'experience' in an RPG than growing
                numbers on a stat sheet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img
                data-fullimage-src="http://e5c351ecddc2f880ef72-57d6ff1fc59ab172ec418789d348b0c1.r69.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/gyX3FLE8S9Oc.jpg"
                src="http://ec0c5a7f741a6f3bff65-dd07187202f57fa404a8f047da2bcff5.r85.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/0aD_ptvWOuYf.878x0.Z-Z96KYq.jpg"
                alt="Dark Souls gesture 2" class="" style="background-color: initial;"&gt;I use
                gestures all the time, even when there's no one else in my game. I'll reserve a
                bow for Dark Souls' most tragic bosses. I'm also fond of the the Darkmoon
                Loyalty gesture that causes your avatar to take a knee in the dignified repose
                of a committed, honourable warrior. It also happens to mirror the brooding
                rooftop poise of a different sort of dark knight. Whenever I need to wait for an
                elevator or find a scenic perch, this is the gesture for me. I have no
                affiliation with the Darkmoon covenant, but I'm bound to love a system that
                allows me to&amp;nbsp;look like Batman. It's one small, perfect system in an
                outstanding game.&lt;/p&gt;

                Studios' previous game, the influential&amp;nbsp;&lt;a

                target="_blank"&gt;Slender: The Arrival&lt;/a&gt;. For one thing, it doesn't
                seem to feature any slendermen&amp;mdash;in fact, shock-based
                horror&amp;nbsp;seems to be off the table entirely. Instead, it's first person
                action-adventure-type-thing about a guy in a supersuit that lets him run, jump
                and grapple his way around a mysterious valley. You can see all of those things
                in the reveal trailer, below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe width="854" height="480"

                the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/378610/"
                target="_blank"&gt;Steam page&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Valley is a
                First-Person adventure unlike any other. Hidden deep within a remote region of
                the Rocky Mountains, you find yourself bewildered within a secluded valley. With
                the power of a recently discovered L.E.A.F. suit (Leap Effortlessly though Air
                Functionality), run and jump your way through beautiful forests, dangerous ruins
                and vast environments; all the while utilizing the power to control life and
                death to uncover the startling secrets of the mysterious
                valley."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, the power to control life and death
                comes with a downside. If you die in the game, &lt;del&gt;you die for
                real&lt;/del&gt; the valley will die around you. It's unclear what that means,
                exactly&amp;mdash;whether it will be a&amp;nbsp;temporary effect, or whether the
                world will permanently lose lustre if you're rubbish at the game&amp;mdash;but I
                suppose we'll find out closer to this&amp;nbsp;Summer, which is when Valley is
                scheduled to come out.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;strong&gt;4GB GTX 960&lt;/strong&gt; is the cheapest version around and
                &lt;strong&gt;AMD's R9&lt;/strong&gt; Nano has hit a decent price
                too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or you could just go big and pick up a full-fat

                alt="SSD deals 16 9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you go solid state you can't go
                back. But there are so many on the market how do you know what the best SSD deal
                is? That's where we come in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When they first appeared on the
                PC scene the solid state drive was very much a luxury item, and even then
                capacities of 250GB seemed like extreme extravagance. Now the SSD is almost an
                expected component of a proper gaming PC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And gone are the
                lowly 30-60GB capacity SSDs too, with even a 120GB drive looking like a miserly
                amount of space for your Steam library. For just £45 you can now pick up a 240GB
                SSD which will outperform even the most expensive drives of just a few years
                back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you’ve already checked out&amp;nbsp; &lt;a

                guide to the best SSD&lt;/a&gt; then you’ll already have an idea what you’re
                after, but if you want them for the absolute best price then allow&amp;nbsp;us

                version of the awesome &lt;strong&gt;Samsung 850 EVO&lt;/strong&gt; is still
                dropping in price and has shed a few pounds over at Amazon this
                week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But being able to get a decent terabyte-class SSD for
                just £168 would have been but a pipe dream not so long back - now you can grab
                the &lt;strong&gt;960GB SanDisk Ultra II&lt;/strong&gt; for just

                suffering from (strangely localised)&amp;nbsp;memory loss, and you've forgotten
                what Battlefleet Gothic is all about? You, my friend, need to get a load of the
                launch trailer, which offers a nice overview of the campy, super-serious premise
                of this latest Warhammer game. Here's an even shorter overview: cathedrals, but
                they're spaceships, oh and they explode each other with giant lasers. This all
                looks very mad and fun indeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe width="854" height="480"

                its first two months&amp;mdash;a smart way to discourage people from waiting for
                a sale. That content comprises the Space Marines faction, along with another

                initial;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 'Now Playing' articles PC Gamer writers talk
                about the game currently dominating their spare time. Today Phil plays the game
                of trying to play a game on Windows
                10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: This article was originally
                published in PC Gamer issue 290, before the Steam edition had been
                announced.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hitman: Go is a surprisingly enjoyable
                turn-based puzzler. It’s styled like a board game, where your job is to move
                your Agent 47 piece towards the target without being seen by the patrolling
                guards. In essence, it’s a series of maze puzzles. Like The Witness, but with
                murder. I don’t really do mobile gaming, so I’d only tapped my way through a
                couple of levels of the Android edition. But the PC version seemed like a fine
                lunchtime distraction.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can’t simply play the game,
                though, because for some reason Square Enix neglected to release it on Steam.
                Instead, Hitman: Go is only available through the Windows 10 Store. That means
                installing Windows 10. This isn’t a particularly big deal&amp;mdash;I use
                Windows 10 on my home PC and like it well enough. It was only a matter of time
                before my work PC followed suit. Things do get a little hairy when the system
                freezes during the initial configuration, on the screen that warns me not to
                turn off my PC. It sounds like good advice, but I don’t really see another
                option. I turn off my PC.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restarting, it loads the
                Windows 10 upgrade procedure. Things appear to be fine, despite my disobeying
                the only command I’ve been given. Twenty minutes later, the OS is installed and
                I’m almost ready to buy the game. Nearly. First I have to go through every
                option, tweaking Microsoft’s many, many privacy settings. It’s as I’m disabling
                Big Brother that my screen goes blank.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img
                data-fullimage-src="http://e5c351ecddc2f880ef72-57d6ff1fc59ab172ec418789d348b0c1.r69.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/agzlvWltR0my.jpg"

                alt="Hitman Go 2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I restart, and a couple of minutes later
                my screen goes blank again. I suspect – hope&amp;mdash;this is a display driver
                issue. Not a problem, I’ll just download the Windows 10 version of the latest
                driver. Restarting, I open Nvidia’s GeForce experience tool and click to
                download a driver update. The screen goes blank.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At
                this point, I’m not really thinking about Hitman: Go any more. I’m scheduled for
                a Skype interview directly&amp;nbsp;after lunch and I’d rather not tell the
                founder of Taleworlds that I can’t make our appointment because I’d wanted to
                play a puzzle game. As against-the-clock drama goes, this is hardly 24. Still,
                if I’m going to destroy what little professional reputation I’ve built up over
                the years, I’d rather it was because of something less
                stupid.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;It feels like my PC is playing
                Roadrunner to my Wile E Coyote&amp;mdash;waiting for me to get within seconds of
                starting the update, then cutting the display before I
                can.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;After numerous further attempts, it feels like
                my PC is playing Roadrunner to my Wile E Coyote&amp;mdash;waiting for me to get
                within seconds of starting the update, then cutting the display before I can.
                Clearly a change of approach is needed. I manually download the driver update on
                my Mac, and pop it onto a USB stick. With the file transferred to Windows, I can
                finally... oh no. The driver update won’t run in safe
                mode.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I restart and cross my fingers. As I navigate
                towards the update folder, my screen goes blank. This time, it immediately
                flickers back to life. Not taking any chances I run the update. With five
                minutes left of my lunch break, I buy Hitman: Go and play the first couple of
                levels. It’s good, but probably not worth the effort. A couple of hours later
                I’m in the process of transcribing my interview. Without warning, my screen goes
                blank.&lt;/p&gt;

                alt="Dark Souls Comedy Tragedy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dark Souls 3 has been out
                for nearly a week now, and in that short space of time, it’s caused more
                combined&amp;nbsp;anger and&amp;nbsp;elation than any game in recent memory. As
                proof, I’ve assembled a slice of the best examples from the community so far. A
                few players get acquainted with the unforgiving enemies of Lothric, one
                exercises deceit under the guise of a familiar face, and another roleplays a
                box&amp;mdash;a super deadly box.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you’re a Dark
                Souls player, they’re worth watching for the solidarity. Knowing you’re not the
                only one to fall for that first Mimic might be the motivation you need to get
                back on the horse. If you’re not a Dark Souls player, well, if you can laugh at
                a person slipping on a banana peel then you’ll find plenty to like here. Dark
                Souls is essentially a game designed around accidental
                slapstick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shields up, Unkindled. The Axe Man
                cometh.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Life, Death, and Axes: Part
                One&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;img class="gfyitem" alt="PastelOrnateAmericanmarten

                href="http://i.imgur.com/3DvCngy.gifv"&gt;This gif&lt;/a&gt; is a microcosm of
                the entire Dark Souls experience. It begins with the unlucky player reading a
                seemingly helpful message. "No dragon ahead," it says, and a gesturing spirit
                points ahead. Wow. That's the power of asynchronous cooperati&amp;mdash;oh shit,
                nope. There's a dragon. The player stands there, paralyzed with indecision,
                possibly processing their recent betrayal, the futility of trust, love,
                life&amp;mdash;but before they have time to consider a
                single&amp;nbsp;rhetorical question, an axe man leaps from offscreen and answers
                them all at once with a swift&amp;nbsp;death. &lt;em&gt;Dark
                Souls!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dark Souls 3 isn’t that
                bad&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;iframe width="500" height="281"
                src="//www.youtube.com/embed/OhxzZER_A6g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""&gt;
                &lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt; Never say this. Never say anything like it. Do not do
                as &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhxzZER_A6g"&gt;this player
                does&lt;/a&gt; (unless you film it for our entertainment). You might as well
                shout Macbeth in a Broadway theater. You might as well lather yourself in honey,
                go camping in Alaska, and tell yourself ‘bears are pretty chill, actually!’ You
                might as well hang upside down from the highest branch in a tall oak and say
                ‘gravity is easy!’ and let go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Harmful
                harmonics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;iframe width="500" height="281"
                src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Vf3Wj_d-aOE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""&gt;
                &lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of Dark Souls' most memorable armor sets returns in
                Dark Souls 3&amp;mdash;memorable for its thorny decoration that damages anything
                it comes into contact with during a dodge roll. Kirk, Knight of Thorns is back,
                and this time he's not alone.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A gang of bandits
                decked out in the armor&amp;nbsp;is running amok in Lothric, repeatedly rolling
                into its citizens until they are dead.&amp;nbsp;Keep your eyes peeled for a gang
                of ninjas while you're at it. They're committing an even more serious
                crime&amp;mdash;one&amp;nbsp;against
                &lt;em&gt;anime.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe width="500"

                captured and assembled into the two montages above. The catchy tunes are a
                flourish too far for such a serious offense, but videos this important need as
                much reach as possible when trying to nab such prickly, sprightly
                perps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Watchdog Militia&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;iframe width="500"

                allowfullscreen=""&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt; I’ve never been chased through a
                swamp by a crowd of purple people, but Dark Souls 3 &lt;a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiB_Sqf17vY"&gt;has finally made it a
                possibility&lt;/a&gt;. Watch what happens when an invasion goes exactly
                right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fly like an eagle. A limp,&amp;nbsp;lifeless

                &lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt; There really can be beauty in death, as illustrated by
                &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XzlTrxwD8E"&gt;this particularly

                the best place for a fair one-on-one duel, especially near the rickety rope

                &lt;p&gt;&lt;img
                data-fullimage-src="http://4d663a369f9f03c3c61e-870e77779efd63f7bd6c2ee08d8cfae6.r2.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/Wcid0s4YSmup.jpg"

                alt="Is Defense"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terror group ISIS has taken over North
                Africa in the year 2020, and begun a push into Europe, beginning with Italy. The
                introductory cinematic for IS Defense takes us step-by-step (plus several dozen
                more steps) through the situation, with the narration ending: "The situation was
                dire, and the forces of NATO united for the first time in history in order to
                repel the invasion."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cut to: a single soldier in a machine gun
                nest on a beach. That's you! Good luck defending the entirety of Italy alone
                against thousands of heavily armed terrorists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, you're
                not entirely alone in this fixed-position shooter made by Destructive Creations,
                creators of the controversial but &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/hatred-review/"&gt;ultimately unremarkable
                twin-stick shooter Hatred&lt;/a&gt;. As you defend Europe from ISIS on one of
                the three different maps (yes, a whopping total of three), you gain points that
                allow you to call in supply drops, reinforcements, artillery, and air
                strikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's talk about ISIS's naval assault, in which small
                motor boats speed to shore, stop instantly, and expel terrorists, and in which
                larger transport ships arrive and dispense... white Toyota pickup trucks. So,
                ISIS has conquered several countries, including their military infrastructure,
                and is now invading Italy in pickup trucks. Well, I guess that explains why NATO
                only stationed a single soldier on the
                beach.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img
                data-fullimage-src="http://ec0c5a7f741a6f3bff65-dd07187202f57fa404a8f047da2bcff5.r85.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/ePUwFh-TS5a5.jpg"
                src="http://0cb8dd5d2dc142d08f0f-eb3b436d25971e5860b39e72b0600342.r94.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/9PnTaWlXuBfH.878x0.Z-Z96KYq.jpg"
                alt="Is Defense"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As scores of terrorists storm the beach
                you swivel from side to side and shoot them with your machinegun and rocket
                launcher, and... that is pretty much the entire videogame. Call in
                reinforcements and two or three UN soldiers arrive and stand on the beach in
                front of your nest, unprotected and barely moving. As you kill more enemies,
                you're awarded skill points you can invest in upgrades to health, weapons, and
                reinforcements. Your skill increases and death tally are persistent, so even
                when you die (you will, often, there are a lot of Terries) you start over with
                your earnings intact. Kill 2,000 members of ISIS and destroy 200 vehicles, and
                you can begin playing on the second (again, of three total)
                maps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not much fun! The entirety of IS Defense is like a
                turret sequence from a bigger game, the kind of sequence that we tend to hate
                when we have to play through them. It's also not a well-made game in general.
                Hit detection, as in Hatred, is spotty. Sometimes a single shot or two will drop
                an attacker, other times a long spray of dead-on hits appear to pass right
                through them. Not much AI is required to have one million dipshits run straight
                at you forever, but they somehow even messed that up: I've watched a few enemies
                run across the beach sideways, slowly, one end to the other, without ever
                attacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img
                data-fullimage-src="http://e5c351ecddc2f880ef72-57d6ff1fc59ab172ec418789d348b0c1.r69.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/jf9cly6BRYqz.jpg"

                alt="Is Defense"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enemy drivers follow the same routes in
                their Toyotas, piling one after another into the burning wrecks of earlier
                drivers, though at least that can be funny to watch and lets you chain some
                explosions together. Your reinforcements stand there stupidly and allow
                themselves to be run down by vehicles or simply shot dead. I've also encountered
                long stretches where almost nothing happens. Sometimes the chaotic assault will
                pause, and after a while only one little boat will show up, miles down the
                beach, and me and my brainless UN meatbags have nothing to do but just sit
                there, waiting for them to run close enough to be
                shredded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a shame, because there is some talent evident
                at Destructive Creations. Hatred occasionally looked great, and IS Defense looks
                fantastic. I like the reinforcement system, which can force you to make tough
                choices. Call in a supply drop, or wait until you have enough points to rally
                some troops or air support? Amidst the mindless, endless shooting it can make
                for some occasionally bracing moments, when you're out of rockets and bleeding
                health, but desperately want to hang on long enough to call in a chopper. The
                skills upgrades are mostly unimaginative boosts to your health and weapons, but
                the effects are immediately noticeable and once your main gun has been upgraded
                it becomes a little more enjoyable to use, though that's only in comparison to
                how initially bland and toothless it is to fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img

                alt="Is Defense"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IS Defense isn't really much of a game.
                Again, there's three freakin' maps and nothing terribly interesting or even that
                fun going on except for some nice explosions and visuals, and the occasional
                laugh at some AI misfire or ragdoll. It's pretty cheap at $8/£5.5, but it feels
                like half a game that is only half-made. I checked, twice, to see if it was an
                Early Access release, but I guess this is it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question
                some are perhaps dying to know: is it offensive? I dunno. I didn't find it so,
                but that doesn’t mean others won’t or can’t. Killing thousands of bad guys from
                the Middle East is certainly nothing new in games (or pop&amp;nbsp;culture in
                general), so I found it no more or less distasteful than any number of shooters.
                Maybe it’s just another attempt by Destructive Creations to generate attention
                from hot-button topics and real-life misery just to sell another not-good game.
                If you're looking for offensive, though, you can always browse the predictably
                glowing Steam reviews from people who have played for 0.2 hours. If you're just
                looking to grow bored quickly, you can play the game itself.&lt;/p&gt;

                target="_blank"&gt;unwilling to detail the patch&lt;/a&gt; before now,
                supposedly "to delight you with what we ship, not with talk and promises." I
                think it was just because it would have taken ages&amp;mdash;these

                target="_blank"&gt;the longest patch notes&lt;/a&gt; I have ever seen. To
                summarise brutally: life has got a whole lot
                easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every&amp;nbsp;&lt;a

                target="_blank"&gt;Heart of Thorns&lt;/a&gt; owner, now or in future, will get a
                free boost to level 80 in order to wade into the fight against Mordremoth.
                "Because so much of our Heart of Thorns content is for level-80 players," ANet
                says,&amp;nbsp;"we want everyone to be able to experience this content as soon
                as possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img

                alt="Fractal Backpiece Guild Wars 2 Heart of Thorns"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
                boost is only usable once, so you'll want to be sure the character you choose is
                a keeper. For this reason, the boost comes with a trial mode that warps you to
                Silverwastes for a level-80 test drive. You can't leave Silverwastes, but the
                trial is otherwise unlimited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ride is smoother if you
                don't choose to boost too. Creatures give 50% more XP, Heart of Thorns event
                rewards no longer suffer diminishing returns, loot has been streamlined to free
                up inventory slots, and adventures are easier to complete and reward more
                XP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img

                alliances between low-pop worlds to give them the numbers to make an impact.
                It's in beta, and matchmaking has been reset, so expect crazy variation in your
                opponents&amp;nbsp;for the next few weeks.&amp;nbsp;There are significant WvW
                changes in addition to the headline news, so if you're given to sparring, do
                read up carefully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exploring has been made more convenient,
                causing Edmund Hillary to turn in his grave. Major waypoints have been made
                uncontested, allowing you to zip about hoovering up the extra loot from new
                dailies, achievements and events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img

                minor tweaks, but if I go on much longer the sun will start setting. This is a
                relentless, sweeping patch, with the potential to cause controversy, but so far
                the reaction on the forums is upbeat. Are you a long-time Heart of Thorns
                player? How does the overhaul strike you?&lt;/p&gt;

                Roll&lt;/a&gt; is a puzzle game about grilling sausages. You advance in each
                area&amp;nbsp;by grilling a number of bangers to perfection, while managing each
                stage's&amp;nbsp;layout, and other obstacles that make grilling a more complex
                affair than you may be expecting. If it sounds like a joke game, it's not: in
                fact, people are&amp;nbsp;relishing&amp;nbsp;it with rapturous praise, including
                The Witness/Braid developer Jonathan Blow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can't speak to
                that, as I've not played it,&amp;nbsp;but I think it's worth checking out if you
                like Sokoban-style&amp;nbsp;puzzle games. The&amp;nbsp;&lt;a

                page&lt;/a&gt; is deliberately light on info, so if you aren't aware of
                creator&amp;nbsp;Stephen Lavelle's vast and fascinating&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
                href="http://www.increpare.com/"
                target="_blank"&gt;back-catalogue&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;you might have chuckled at
                the title, dismissed the game, and carried on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't do that.
                Give it another look, starting with this sausagefest of a
                trailer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe width="854" height="480"

                allowfullscreen=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;Predictably, the
                relatively-high-price-for-an-indie-game has resulted in a few angry/bewildered
                Steam forum comments, but from&amp;nbsp;everything I've gathered, this seems to
                be a pretty substantial game.&lt;/p&gt;

                in general&amp;mdash;this morning, instead of Coffee Mate, I added coffee to my

                target="_blank"&gt;Always Sometimes Monsters&lt;/a&gt; (click to read our
                review).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's &lt;a
                href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/441440" target="_blank"&gt;on Steam
                here&lt;/a&gt;, where it's being described as an&amp;nbsp;"antithetical sequel"
                to the 2014 RPG. To which I'd add, "Woo, the sprites are bigger and
                much&amp;nbsp;more detailed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's the
                setup:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With your love at your side and your first book on the
                best-seller list, there's nothing that seems impossible to you. You've set the
                pain of your struggles behind you and settled into a comfortable life of
                stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"After all you've been through, surely there is no
                doubt it's well deserved. However, despite all you've earned, dissenting voices
                whisper of you from obscurity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They call you a monster,
                manipulative and unrepentant. Some seethe with jealousy, others send you
                unwarranted praise. Fanatics regard you with reverence, while the old guard
                question your true worth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Only You Can Decide If they're
                Right."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img
                data-fullimage-src="http://36646d87786feafc0611-0338bbbce19fc98919c6293def4c5554.r0.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/afNqp9MhSAu0.jpg"

                alt="Sometimes Always Monsters 2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that sounds like a
                game I want to play. But I should probably start with the original, as you'll be
                able to import your save from ASM into SAM, so that your characters and choices
                will carry across.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The confusing name does make some sense.
                While Always Sometimes Monsters begins with a struggling author and goes from
                there, Sometimes Always Monsters inverts the premise, starting you as a
                successful writer whose life goes awry. It sounds fascinating, and while this
                new game doesn't have a release date other than simply "2016", there is a
                trailer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe width="640" height="360"

                offers A Fistful of Gun, Ronin, and Gods Will Be Watching at the
                pay-what-you-want tier. But if you beat the average (the average currently
                stands at just over $4), you'll also get clown-based adventure game
                Dropsy,&amp;nbsp;gun-based gun-game Not a Hero, and slicing-baddies-up-'em-up
                Shadow Warrior too. That's quite a good deal, is what it
                is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As ever, more games for the beat-the-average tier will be
                revealed in due course, but if you want Titan Souls and Hatofield Boyfriend:
                Holiday Star thrown in as well, you'll have to fork over $10 or
                more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There. I finally own all the games that have ever gamed.
                Can developers stop releasing them for, oh, let's say&amp;nbsp;30 years
                please?&lt;/p&gt;

                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/dark-souls/"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt; enthusiasts
                took a three minute break from praising the sun today in order to fund a Dark
                Souls board game. That's no exaggeration: the&amp;nbsp;£50,000 goal was reached
                within three minutes, according to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
                href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/steamforged/dark-soulstm-the-board-game/posts/1552094"&gt;an
                update&lt;/a&gt; on the project's&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
                href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/steamforged/dark-soulstm-the-board-game"&gt;Kickstarter
                page&lt;/a&gt;, and at the time of writing it has amassed&amp;nbsp;£391,644. By
                the time you read this, that figure will likely have
                risen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's an impressive figure – few video games can boast
                such successful crowdfunding campaigns nowadays – but it's not for nothing. I'm
                no expert in the board game department (that's best left for Evan or Wes), but
                the package looks pretty cool. Two boss characters have been revealed so far in
                the form of Smough&amp;nbsp;&amp;amp; Ornstein and the Dancer of the Boreal
                Valley. There are four playable classes taken straight from the game, and it
                looks like invasions are in as well.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video below
                provides a decent overview of how it'll work and why you should care. If you can
                spare the five minutes from your Dark Souls 3 NG+ run, that
                is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe width="510" height="287"

                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/the-technomancer/"&gt;The Technomancer&lt;/a&gt; is
                a forthcoming sci-fi RPG by the same studio responsible for&amp;nbsp;&lt;a

                and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.pcgamer.com/bound-by-flame-review/"&gt;Bound
                By Flame&lt;/a&gt;. Neither of those games rated especially well, but studio
                Spiders does have an admirable dedication to the low-budget action RPG, and they
                might just nail the formula with this outing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set on
                Mars, the protagonist is Zachariah, who belongs to a Martian corporation by the
                name of Abundance. There are three specialisations for Zachariah, all related to
                combat, which confirms that you'll definitely be killing lots of nasty enemies
                during your adventure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's some more details on
                the combat options, straight from a recent dev diary on the PlayStation
                blog:&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;-&amp;nbsp;The combat with the staff is based
                on mobility and damage, using sweeping blows against groups comprising several
                enemies.&lt;br&gt;-&amp;nbsp;Fighting with Blade and gun requires agility,
                dodging, and controlling the pace of combat with the nail
                gun.&lt;br&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Finally, the Blade and shield
                combat style focuses on defence, blocking and parrying to inflict heavy damage
                in response to an attack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game launches on June
                21.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                see, it's got orcs, lots of vaguely profound war-related aphorisms and some
                thematically inappropriate electronic music.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
                Duncan Jones directed film will arrive in cinemas on June 16. The newest trailer
                follows another, much shorter one&amp;nbsp;&lt;a

                Program&lt;/a&gt; has just received a 'Turbo Charged' 1.1 update, and as the
                name implies, it speeds the game up. Thanks to an update to Unity 5, the
                spaceship building sim will experience "a large boost in performance", and
                modding will be much more flexible, too.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The update
                will also roll out a new user interface –&amp;nbsp;a byproduct of the move to
                Unity 5. "Almost all interface elements have been redesigned and tweaked but
                have retained the familiar feel for experienced players," the update notes
                read.&amp;nbsp;"The most notable tweaks can be found in the map view, staging,
                IVA portraits and the right-click part menus."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile,
                there's a new KSPedia for newcomers, which is basically an in-built user's
                manual. It'll contain information ranging building and flying, through to
                docking and "in-situ resource utilisation". To hammer home the accessibility
                angle, there are new tutorials and scenarios as well. For the full round down,

                you haven't already played Kerbal Space Program then I strongly advise you do:
                it won our "&lt;a

                simulation&lt;/a&gt;" award last year, with Tom Senior describing it as "a
                brilliant sandbox game that simulates one of the most exciting endeavours our
                species has ever attempted".&lt;/p&gt;

                alt="Alex St John"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DirectX co-creator and co-founder of
                the WildTangent gaming network&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alex St. John has
                been in the games business&amp;nbsp;for a long time now. He's one of the
                creators of Microsoft's DirectX platform, he co-founded WildTangent, and served
                as the president of the social networking/online gaming site Hi5. So he's plenty
                familiar with the ways the&amp;nbsp;industry works.&amp;nbsp;Which goes a long
                way toward explaining the angry&amp;nbsp;reaction to a recent opinion piece he
                penned for &lt;a
                href="http://venturebeat.com/2016/04/16/game-developers-must-avoid-the-wage-slave-attitude/"&gt;VentureBeat&lt;/a&gt;,
                in which he accused game developers of adopting a “wage-slave attitude” because
                they had the temerity to expect&amp;nbsp;to be paid fairly for the work they're
                contracted to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crux of his&amp;nbsp;article
                centers&amp;nbsp;on “crunch,” those long stretches of outrageous hours that
                developers are often forced to undertake in order to just&amp;nbsp;get a game
                out on, or at least near, schedule&amp;mdash;often without being paid for the
                overtime hours. It's been an issue for ages; developer and writer Erin Hoffman
                dragged the problem into the light all the way back in 2004 as “&lt;a
                href="http://ea-spouse.livejournal.com/274.html"&gt;EA Spouse&lt;/a&gt;,” when
                she wrote about the long, disruptive hours being put in by her husband, who at
                the time worked for EA. But it's still an all&amp;nbsp;too&amp;nbsp;common
                industry practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that's how it should be, according to
                St. John. “Every legendary game developer I’ve ever known pursued gaming as a
                vocation out of sheer passion. Most could have made more money, had more
                security, lived more “balanced lives” in other tech jobs, but they wanted to
                make games and they pursued it 110 percent all the time. Not a single person I
                have ever known who went on to greatness in the gaming industry has ever
                exhibited a shred of wage-slavishness,” he wrote. “Making games is not a
                job&amp;mdash;it’s an art.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"You need to get an
                actual job producing productivity software if you want to be paid 'fairly' and
                go home at 5 p.m."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s no amount of money that
                anybody can pay people with a wage-slave attitude to let it go and put
                themselves completely into a great game. There’s nothing that can compensate
                people 'fairly' for the sacrifices that great art requires. It’s art. You need
                to get an actual job producing productivity software if you want to be paid
                'fairly' and go home at 5 p.m. Anybody good enough to get hired to write games
                can get paid more to work on something else. If working on a game for 80 hours a
                week for months at a time seems 'strenuous' to you &amp;hellip; practice more
                until you’re better at it. Making games is not a job, pushing a mouse is not a
                hardship, it’s the most amazing opportunity you can possibly get paid to
                pursue... start believing it, and you’ll discover that you are even better at
                it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's telling that St. John felt the need to put “fairly”
                into quotes, the obvious implication being that he believes the
                pay-for-work-performed social contract is evidence of a character flaw in the
                worker&amp;nbsp;rather than just, you know... fair. And yet somehow, that
                manages to not be the most ridiculous thing he argues&amp;nbsp;in the article;
                your mileage may vary, but I'd say his suggestion that 15-hour workdays (for
                employers who are generous enough to allow for Sundays off) over the course of
                multiple months is not “strenuous” tops the list. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Game dev
                disagrees&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lots of readers &lt;a
                href="https://medium.com/@GurthSnisley/game-developers-must-avoid-the-pay-me-for-my-work-attitude-35d354ff3832#.5jv6kz3fc"&gt;disagreed
                vehemently&lt;/a&gt; and vocally with St. John's screed, but one particularly
                noteworthy response came from Rami Ismail, one-half of indie studio Vlambeer,
                whose games include Super Crate Box, Ridiculous Fishing, Nuclear Throne, Serious
                Sam: The Random Encounter, and my favorite, Luftrausers. His “&lt;a
                href="http://ramiismail.com/2016/04/an-inline-response-to-wage-slaves/"&gt;inline
                response&lt;/a&gt;” to the article made a number of valid criticisms of St.
                John's idea of the ideal employee, but there's one line in particular that
                really nails it: “Your complaint here is literally that someone asked to be paid

                Fishing, Luftrausers, Nuclear Throne&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Great games
                &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be made by giving them everything you’ve got and more,
                and great studios and developers are made by not &lt;em&gt;burning the fuck
                out&lt;/em&gt;. Turns out great studios and developers make better games,
                because they have more experience that they can apply because they did
                &lt;em&gt;not burn the fuck out&lt;/em&gt;,” he wrote. “Wage-slave attitude just
                means ‘employee’ here and thank you very much but those hundreds of
                ‘wage-slaves’ that work on each AAA title deserve not just our utmost respect,
                but also reasonable wages and working hours.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loving your job
                is great&amp;mdash;vital, even&amp;mdash;but it doesn't change the fact if
                you're putting in 80-hour weeks as a regular thing, you are going to suffer for
                it, and ultimately, so is your work. But it's difficult to overcome an
                “addiction” to crunch because, as this &lt;a
                href="http://kotaku.com/crunch-time-why-game-developers-work-such-insane-hours-1704744577"&gt;Kotaku&lt;/a&gt;
                article from last year points out, it feeds on itself: Results achieved through
                a horrific period of crunch become the benchmark for future projects, so what
                should have become an exceptional one-off instead becomes the
                norm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“I tell you here and now: Structural crunch is
                bad, and burning out is real."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The face-slapping
                irony is that St. John's career at Microsoft came to an end, according to this
                &lt;a
                href="http://www.informationtechnologyleaders.com/stvid.html"&gt;Information
                Technology Leaders&lt;/a&gt; bio, because of burnout. “St. John started to burn
                out. He would pass out at his keyboard and straggle into morning meetings with
                key marks on his face,” it says. “Work sucked everything out of him; his
                marriage disintegrated. In 1997, he succeeded in getting himself fired, as he
                tells it, 'and walked out of Microsoft feeling 100 lbs. lighter.'"
                &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;St. John addressed that apparent dichotomy in a &lt;a
                href="http://www.alexstjohn.com/WP/2016/04/17/wage-slaves/"&gt;follow-up
                post&lt;/a&gt; on his personal blog, in which he said that he and “thousands of
                other kids” made millions working years of 120-hour weeks at Microsoft. “What’s
                sad is that all of these successful people don’t talk about the values that got
                them there because they don’t need the hassle of being screamed down for being
                'wealthy beyond good taste',” he wrote. “When did it become gouache [sic] for
                successful people to talk about what they really did and valued to achieve
                success?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's a fair question, and there are certainly
                people who are willing to, and even &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to, put in crazy
                kinds of hours on projects they feel passionately about. But St. John appears to
                be missing an important point: His stint at Microsoft was self-destructive, but
                also extremely lucrative; he made sacrifices, and earned millions. Yet in his
                VentureBeat article, he specifically criticizes game industry employees
                “whining... about not being paid fairly by some big employer.” In other words,
                for asking for precisely what he got&amp;mdash;in principle, if not in
                straight-up dollars&amp;mdash;for what he did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's why the
                near-universal rejection of St. John's ridiculous assertion by those working in
                development today&amp;nbsp;was&amp;nbsp;so welcome and important.
                Video&amp;nbsp;games can be art, and the creation of art can be its own reward.
                But it's also a big, booming business that employs thousands of people. I have
                no doubt that a lot of the people who work at those outfits&amp;mdash;maybe most
                of them!&amp;mdash;love what they do. But a lot has changed over the past 25
                years, and the self-flagellating nonsense that may have seemed reasonable when a
                half-dozen guys were making Wolfenstein 3D just doesn't hold water when a game
                like Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare takes that number of &lt;em&gt;entire
                studios&lt;/em&gt; to create. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It all reminds me of Harlan
                Ellison's famous “&lt;a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mj5IV23g-fE"&gt;Pay the Writer&lt;/a&gt;”
                rant from several years ago, in which the famed author and hothead went on a
                tear about being asked to contribute work to a Babylon 5 DVD set without being
                paid. The subject was different&amp;mdash;he was specifically angry about
                writers not being paid, and not demanding to be paid, for their
                work&amp;mdash;but the bottom line is much the same: People are entitled to fair
                pay for work performed. You would not, as he says, ask your doctor to take out
                your spleen for nothing. So why would you criticize employees at a major game
                studio for not wanting to put in untold hours of unpaid
                work?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Real engineers don't value money... The money
                is for the wife or GF."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;St. John's blog
                post doubles down on his criticism of “lazy millennial hipster game developers”
                who are “upset at the suggestion that 'Thinking' isn’t really hard work.” But
                while there's no denying that ambition and drive can be valuable character
                traits, a &lt;a
                href="http://www.alexstjohn.com/WP/download/Recruiting%20Giants.pdf"&gt;PDF
                presentation&lt;/a&gt; on his site entitled “Recruiting, Training, and Retaining
                Giants” suggest his attitude towards employees is&amp;nbsp;deeply troubling, and
                arguably grotesque. Its snippets of management wisdom include gems like, “Real
                engineers don't burn out until their wives or GFs do,” “Real engineers don't
                value money (the money is for the wife or GF),” “Work them 'too hard' it's good
                for them and the only way they get seasoned,” and best of all, “Be on the
                lookout for the holy grail... the undiscovered Asperger's engineer. (They work
                like machines, don't engage in politics, don't develop attitudes, and never
                change jobs.)”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img
                data-fullimage-src="http://36646d87786feafc0611-0338bbbce19fc98919c6293def4c5554.r0.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/I6sPBTywRWa3.jpg"

                alt="Coding is never work"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken as a whole, it's a
                startlingly&amp;nbsp;retrograde attitude toward productivity that would be
                hilarious if it didn't have a very real, very negative impact on the lives of
                actual&amp;nbsp;people. And maybe treating workers like pack mules gets the job
                done, in some imperfect way, at large studios where employees come and go in an
                endless, anonymous ebb and flow. But for people who view working in the games
                industry as a long-term career option and not just something to do until
                something better comes along, Ismail has the right of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I
                tell you here and now: structural crunch is bad, and burning out is real,” he
                wrote. “I hope you’ll take care of yourself, so we can have you and your games
                and your experience around in this industry for many more years to come. Whether
                it’s as a 9-to-5 employee making AAA games, a legendary developer, an indie
                working on their first games, or a part-time developer that makes games for fun.
                Be passionate. Make games. But please take care of you.”&lt;/p&gt;

                alt="Intel Sign"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Confirming earlier rumors of impending
                layoffs, Intel on Tuesday announced plans to eliminate up to 12,000 positions
                globally, which works out to around 11 percent of its total
                workforce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intel's official reasoning for the layoffs is that
                it's in the midst of a restructuring effort. If taken at face value, Intel is
                looking to accelerate its evolution from a PC company to one that powers the
                cloud and billions of smart, connected computing devices, otherwise known as the
                Internet of Things (IoT).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our results demonstrate a strategy
                that’s working and a solid foundation for growth. Our opportunity now is to
                accelerate our momentum and build on our strengths. But this requires some
                difficult decisions. With that context, today we are announcing a restructuring
                initiative that will allow Intel to intensify our investments in the products
                and technologies that fuel our growth, and drive more profitable mobile and PC
                businesses," Intel CEO Brian Krzanich stated in an &lt;a
                href="https://newsroom.intel.com/newsroom/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2016/04/krzanich-restructuring-memo.pdf"
                target="_blank"&gt;open letter to employees
                (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intel is coming off a quarter in which it
                raked in &lt;a
                href="http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/INTC/1917929754x0x886646/374B039B-F62C-4429-99C8-131CA7DE75DF/Earnings_Release_Q1_2016_final.pdf"
                target="_blank"&gt;$13.8 billion in revenue (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; en route to a profit
                of $2.6 billion on a non-GAAP basis. There's probably not many companies that
                would look at those kinds of numbers and conclude that a major reduction in its
                workforce is in order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real reason for the 12,000 layoffs
                might not be found in Intel's official rhetoric. &lt;a
                href="http://recode.net/2016/04/19/intel-chipmaker-mobile-earnings-restructuring/"
                target="_blank"&gt;According to Re/Code&lt;/a&gt;, workforce reduction is the
                result of Intel missing the mobile revolution. It's hard to argue against that
                notion when you look around and see so many smartphone and tablet devices
                running on ARM hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intel's also adjusting to ongoing
                &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/pc-shipments-decline-for-sixth-consecutive-quarter-but-gaming-pcs-are-on-the-rise/"&gt;PC
                shipment declines&lt;/a&gt;. While gaming PC sales are doing fine, PC shipments
                as a whole just fell for the sixth consecutive quarter to 64.8 million units in
                Q1 of this year. That's the first time since 2007 that PC shipments dipped below
                65 million units.&amp;nbsp;The upside is, the &lt;em style="background-color:
                initial;"&gt;PC gaming&lt;/em&gt; space continues to see record
                growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of this is to say that Intel will stop making
                processors. Even though revenue from Intel's Client Computing Group dropped 14
                percent sequentially and two percent year-over-year to $7.5 billion, it was
                still the company's biggest earner, and by a wide margin. The only other segment
                to pull in billions of dollars last quarter was Intel's Data Center Group, which
                added $4 billion to the pile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intel's making itself leaner as
                it looks to increase investments in its cloud and IoT efforts. At the same time,
                Intel said it will look to grow specific client segments, including 2-in-1s,
                gaming, and home gateways. In other words, you can still count on Intel to
                deliver faster processors to keep your gaming rig up to
                date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The takeaway from this? More people need to play games
                and Intel needs to double down on gaming.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vX1s9reuULs?rel=0"
                allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="343"
                width="610"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt; I quite enjoyed Krillbite's &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/among-the-sleep/"&gt;Among the Sleep&lt;/a&gt;, a
                first-person horror-adventure played as a two-year-old boy, although it
                ultimately fell a bit short of my (admittedly high) hopes. &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/the-plan/"&gt;The Plan&lt;/a&gt; was fantastic,
                too, albeit in an entirely different way. So I'm naturally very interested in
                the studio's next game, Mosaic, which looks like it will be another
                unique&amp;nbsp;experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “It's about being a small piece
                in this big machinery that you don't feel anything for,” Krillbite artist
                Bjørnar Frøyse told &lt;a
                href="http://www.polygon.com/2016/3/14/11224974/mosaic-krillbite-studio-among-the-sleep"&gt;Polygon&lt;/a&gt;
                at GDC. Eventually, you start to feel like you don't fit in
                anymore&amp;mdash;and then strange things start to happen. The studio has been
                very coy about the project so far, revealing only a couple of highly-stylized
                teasers and some hints about “urban isolation.” Even the newest trailer, while
                relatively long at 1:18, doesn't really reveal anything about the
                game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Or does it? The website at &lt;a
                href="http://www.themosaicgame.com"&gt;themosaicgame.com&lt;/a&gt; doesn't offer
                much but the promise of a coming teaser and a link to sign up for a mailing
                list, but as a sharp-eyed &lt;a
                href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/4fibsp/mosaic_teaser_trailer/"&gt;Redditor&lt;/a&gt;
                noticed, appending “/login” to the URL leads to a login page&amp;mdash;the same
                one seen at the end of the video. Furthermore, the employee ID entered in the
                trailer (978-0674430006) is the ISBN for Thomas Piketty's book &lt;a
                href="http://www.amazon.com/Capital-Twenty-First-Century-Thomas-Piketty/dp/067443000X?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;keywords=Capital%20in%20the%2021st%20century&amp;amp;qid=1461094802&amp;amp;ref_=sr_1_1&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;Capital
                in the Twenty-First Century&lt;/a&gt;, a long-term examination of the inequality
                of wealth distribution in the US and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Where it goes
                from there is anybody's guess: Another Redditor says the source code on the
                Mosaic login site indicates that the mystery is currently not solvable at all.
                Hard to imagine that something so tantalizing wouldn't ultimately lead
                somewhere, though, and Krillbite itself suggested that there's something going
                on under the hood when it &lt;a
                href="https://twitter.com/krillbite/status/722497483654504452"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;
                a link to the Reddit thread above and wrote, "Have [sic] the mystery started to
                unravel?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've reached out to Krillbite to find out more
                about what's going on. In the meantime, if you get any more of this figured out,
                let us know in the comments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:
                &lt;/strong&gt;It's not much to go on, but Krillbite has confirmed that there is
                some ARG action at work here. "Since everything will evolve while we develop the
                game in the coming year, we won't give away much, but it will be linked to the
                themes of the game, like urban isolation, and capitalism, like the ISBN showed
                now," a rep said. "The story is about a person stuck in a dreadfully boring
                everyday life, and we know a lot of people can relate, and that is why we want
                to merge in ARG elements."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
                &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                alt="Razer Turret"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you've bought into the idea of
                playing PC games on your big screen TV in your living room, you might be
                interested in Razer's new Turret peripheral, which just graduated from prototype
                to a shipping product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Razer's Turret is a three-piece system
                consisting of a wireless laptop keyboard, an integrated magnetic mouse surface,
                and a gaming mouse with a 3,500 DPI sensor. What Razer's trying to do is bring
                keyboard and mouse controls to the couch without the awkwardness of wires or a
                separate surface to lay them on, such as a TV tray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The
                Razer Turret brings the immense world of PC gaming to a previously impossible
                frontier&amp;mdash;the living room&amp;mdash;where only consoles have
                traditionally roamed until now," says Razer Co-Founder and CEO Min-Liang Tan.
                "Finally, we have a perfect solution for gamers to enjoy the unrivaled precision
                of a mouse and keyboard combination from the comfort of the couch with the
                durability and reliability that PC gamers demand."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Turret
                comes with a wireless 2.4GHz adapter for connecting to your PC, though it also
                has Bluetooth LE baked in for hooking up a console. Either way, there are no
                wires to mess with. Razer says it designed the Turret with ergonomics in mind so
                that it fits on a user's lap. The keyboard portion has chiclet styled keycaps,
                and it also has dedicated Android buttons&amp;mdash;for times when you're not
                using it with a PC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When not in use, a foldable hinge allows
                you to tuck the mouse surface beneath the keyboard before plopping it and the
                mouse into a dock. According to Razer, you can get up to four months of usage
                out of the keyboard and 40 hours of nonstop play on the mouse before having to
                charge them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's a cost to the convenience Razer is
                offering, and that cost is $160. If that sounds reasonable, you can purchase one
                &lt;a href="http://www.razerzone.com/store/razer-turret"
                target="_blank"&gt;direct from Razer&lt;/a&gt; today.&lt;/p&gt;

                alt="Asus VG278HV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asus announced a new 27-inch monitor
                for gamers that lacks modern amenities like G-Sync or FreeSync, but what the new
                &lt;a href="https://www.asus.com/Monitors/VG278HV/"
                target="_blank"&gt;VG278HV&lt;/a&gt; does offer is a 144Hz refresh rate and 1ms
                response time for smooth action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That combination is a point
                of focus for Asus, along with its "Splendid Video Intelligence Technology" that
                analyzes what the viewer is doing and adjusts the picture quality accordingly.
                There's also six preset video modes to choose from, and in our experience, best
                results are usually obtained by sticking with a Standard preset and manually
                making color adjustments, if needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The VG278HV uses a TN
                panel and offers a native 1920x1080 resolution which might be a bit on the low
                end for some. More gamers are moving towards 1440p. Other rated specs include a
                maximum brightness of 300 cd/m2, 50,000,000:1 dynamic contrast ratio (1,000:1
                typical), and 170/160 degree viewing angles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can make
                height, swivel, and tilt adjustments to the stand to help find that optimal
                viewing angle. As for connectivity, the VG278HV comes with HDMI, VGA, and DVI-D
                ports, along with a 3.5mm jack. There's also a pair of built-in 3W speakers to
                handle audio chores, though we've yet to be impressed with integrated speakers
                in a monitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not the most exciting monitor in the world,
                but if a 1920x1080 display with a high refresh rate is what you're after, you
                can pick one up now for &lt;a

                alt="CSGO Entry Fragger 1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last time I covered &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/improve-your-support-play-in-counter-strike-global-offensive/"&gt;the
                support role&lt;/a&gt;. This time around we’ll take a closer look at the entry
                fragger: to my mind, the most misunderstood role in
                CS:GO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What does an entry fragger do?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                Just to get it out there: how I view roles in Counter-Strike, and what I think a
                player in that role is supposed to do, may differ a lot from what other people
                might think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So let’s get started. I think that the single
                most important job of an entry fragger is to play aggressively in order to
                create more room for his teammates to execute their strategy. This makes entry
                fragging a team-oriented role. Contrary to what a lot of people I’ve talked to
                believe, especially newer players, the entry fragger won’t put up big numbers
                most of the time. The only exception to this is if he’s playing against a lesser
                team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The entry fragger is, however, the player who gets
                those high-impact kills. If your team is attacking a site with four players and
                you’re facing two players, it’s huge to get that initial kill and turn it into
                it a four-versus-one situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most of the time it’s not the
                entry fragger who initiates the attack (unless the CTs decide to push for
                information). They need to be good at assessing the situation and listen to
                their teammates. It’s crucial that they time the push with the flashbangs that
                are being thrown by support players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another thing that I
                want an entry fragger to do is bait for their teammates. If they jump across a
                tight choke point where an opponent is peeking, chances are that they’ll shoot.
                This means that the entry fragger’s teammate (often the AWPer) can go around the
                corner and either pick up the initial kill or trade a kill before the CT’s
                weapon gets a chance to reset. In most scenarios it’s beneficial for the
                terrorists to trade kills as it’ll make it easier for them to take the bomb
                site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;img
                data-fullimage-src="http://4d663a369f9f03c3c61e-870e77779efd63f7bd6c2ee08d8cfae6.r2.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/0YSl19QQQZSW.jpg"
                src="http://e5c351ecddc2f880ef72-57d6ff1fc59ab172ec418789d348b0c1.r69.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/SN_Mr1pNVRrS.878x0.Z-Z96KYq.jpg"
                alt="CSGO Entry Fragger 2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Who should be an entry
                fragger?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; So you’ve formed a team and you’re trying to figure
                out who’s most suitable as an entry fragger. What should you be looking
                for?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You want an individual who has fast reactions and has
                the ability to clear a lot of angles quickly. You also want them to be good at
                communicating, as they’ll be the one to get information first. If they do what
                they’re supposed to do, you’ll have more room to work with and know roughly
                where the enemies are positioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Your entry fragger can’t
                have trust issues. Because of the number of angles there are on almost every
                site in the game, it’s impossible for them to check all of them. They need to
                trust that the second and third player in are helping out with the spots they
                can’t cover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Above all else, it’s crucial that your entry
                fragger listens to what your in-game leader says. They need to trust their
                leader, because if they hesitate when it’s time to initiate the push you’re a
                lot less likely to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In short, your entry fragger
                should be a humble yet fearless player who’s not afraid of taking one for the
                team. One of the perks of being an entry fragger is the potential for crazy
                highlight clips. They’ll get their moment to shine when they succeed in picking
                up two or three entry kills to secure a site on their
                own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Example from a pro game&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; This example
                is taken from the quarterfinals of Dreamhack Masters Malmö in Sweden last
                weekend. The player featured in the clip is Jonas ‘Lekr0’ Olofsson from GODSENT,
                the team put together by former Major champion and in-game leader Markus
                ‘pronax’ Wallsten. This is the round right after they had lost their first buy
                round against the German team mousesports. GODSENT decided to go for a force buy
                with tec-9s, armor and some grenades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe width="560"
                height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OXA2pD3XZCM" frameborder="0"
                allowfullscreen=""&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lekr0 gets in position for the
                push while his teammates line up their grenades. As soon as they throw the two
                initial smokes, Lekr0 pops a flash in the smoke and runs through it. Andreas
                ‘znajder’ Lindberg (another former Major champion) throws his molotov right next
                to the van in order to clear the spot of any counter-terrorists. Just after the
                flashes come flying over the roof of B-apartments, Lekr0 jumps out through the
                window and manages to kill Timo ‘Spiidi’ Richter while he is still flashed. More
                importantly he makes room for his teammates to take the site. At that point they
                don’t have to worry about any CTs from short or by the van.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                The smokes on either side of the pillar towards short are absolutely beautiful.
                They isolate Lekr0 on short, giving him the opportunity to secure a winnable
                one-versus-one situation should a CT attempt a retake from short. Since this
                wasn’t the case, he could push the smokes to create even more chaos for the
                defenders. He even managed to pick up another kill with a
                grenade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another thing the smokes did was to give Lekr0 a
                chance to save his weapon had the situation turned out differently. With a
                little stretch of the imagination the bomb carrier also had the option to follow
                Lekr0 through the smokes and try to go for the plant over on the
                A-site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the end pronax managed to clutch out the round in
                favor of his team. The strategy was excellent, and because Lekr0 made sure no
                one could attack through the smokes on short GODSENT could swarm the players
                from mousesports on the site. Note that Jonas didn’t just keep going for
                mindless aggressive plays after the initial kill: instead, he slowed down and
                assisted his team. No matter what role you play on your team, you still have to
                be able to do a little bit of everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How to
                practice&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; As with every other role, there are things you can
                and should practice outside of actual matches. You can go on an empty server and
                look for different entry paths you can take when you’re attacking different
                sites. There are 14 bombsites in total and you can push from different
                directions. Needless to say there is a lot of work to be done. You want to be
                able to enter sites in different ways to make yourself less predictable,
                depending on what strategy your team is executing. The more games you play the
                more comfortable you’ll get in knowing what spots are common and which angles to
                prioritize.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="fancy-box"&gt; &lt;h5 class="title"&gt;Pop
                flash&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;p&gt; A flashbang thrown in such a way that it ‘pops’ just
                as it enters your opponent’s field of vision, giving him less time to turn away
                from it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; Try to spend some time trying out
                different things with your support players. Will you get blinded if he throws a
                certain flashbang at a certain time? If so, is there anything you can do to
                correct that? Maybe throw the grenade a split second earlier or later or maybe
                you can make sure to have your back turned to the flash as it
                pops?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’s of utmost importance that you’re comfortable with
                your mouse sensitivity. When you clear angles you want your crosshair placement
                to be as good as it possibly can be. You’ll also need to be able to land flick
                shots when you spot a defending player in an area that you didn’t
                expect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Luckily CS:GO is full of community-made custom maps
                for all sorts of practice purposes. One that I particularly like is &lt;a
                href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?l=swedish&amp;amp;id=213240871"&gt;training_aim_csgo2&lt;/a&gt;.
                Subscribe to the map, go to ‘play’ and then ‘offline with bots’ and then the
                Workshop tab, where you’ll be able to find all the maps you’ve subscribed
                to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here’s an example of what it looks
                like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;img class="gfyitem" alt="EminentUnfitHarborporpoise
                (gfyCat video) " data-id="EminentUnfitHarborporpoise" data-controls="false"
                data-title="false" data-autoplay="true"
                data-expand="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On one of the walls there’s a board
                where you can change your settings. I usually set the delay between the dots to
                0.25 and static target duration to 0.50. If you’re not comfortable with the
                speed you can start a little higher and work your way down. Remember to vary the
                distance as well, so that you get comfortable with your sensitivity on various
                ranges. This way of practicing became immensely popular after Adam ‘friberg’
                Friberg from NiP showed it on his stream in 2014. He said that he tries to go
                for around 80% hits, so don’t get discouraged if you miss a few shots. Even the
                pros miss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Remember that how you play when you practice is
                how you’ll play when you’re under pressure in games because that’s what will
                come naturally to you. Make every practice session count!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Try
                to play aggressively when you’re on deathmatch servers. That way you’ll get more
                used to pushing forward even when the odds are stacked against you. The more aim
                duels you take, the more confident you’ll be when it counts the
                most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Watch the pros play&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can’t stress
                this enough: download a few demos from &lt;a
                href="http://www.hltv.org/"&gt;HLTV.org&lt;/a&gt; and learn from the best. How
                do they push sites and what spots do they clear? In what order? Why? Obviously
                it’s going to be a little bit different when you play (unless you are in fact a
                professional), but you’ll learn the most common spots on your level from just
                playing games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are a lot of good entry fraggers to
                watch. I’d recommend you to take a look at some of the plays Dan ‘apEX’
                Madesclaire from EnVyUs makes. Admittedly his team has fallen off a bit lately,
                but I still consider him one of the best entry fraggers in the
                world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then you have Paweł ‘byali’ Bieliński who plays for
                the Polish team Virtus.Pro. When he’s on form I’d say he is a contender for the
                number one spot in the world when it comes to entry fragging. He can single
                handedly lay waste to some of the strongest CT setups CS:GO’s ever
                seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;img
                data-fullimage-src="http://ec0c5a7f741a6f3bff65-dd07187202f57fa404a8f047da2bcff5.r85.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/QlfbXC1NSiOD.jpg"

                alt="CSGO Entry Fragger 3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For pure entry fragging I’d
                say former Cloud9-player Ryan ‘freakazoid’ Abadir is great to watch. He might
                not be the most skilled player out there, but he’s made a career by being a role
                player. Download some demos from Cloud9’s games from last summer, when Sean
                ‘sg@res’ Gares managed to make the most of the players he had by assigning them
                roles they all seemed to enjoy playing. For a brief period of time they were a
                top team in the international CS:GO scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also, you
                shouldn’t underestimate how much you can learn from watching your own demos.
                It’s tempting to watch the games where you got a lot of highlight worthy kills
                and stomped your opponents and you should do that. That’s a good way to boost
                your confidence as well as to remember what tends to work well for you. Even if
                it’s not as much fun, however, you’ll probably learn more from watching your
                losses and looking for your mistakes. Try to figure out what you could’ve done
                differently and try new things the next time you’re in a similar
                situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One last quick tip that’s been useful to me when
                I’ve played entry fragger: visualize how you’re going to attack and try to have
                a plan ready before you go in. Of course you’ll have to adapt to the situation,
                but it’s helpful to know what to do next once you’ve moved past that corner. The
                fewer decisions you have to make on the fly, the easier it’ll be to focus on
                hitting your shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Find all of our

                allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="343"
                width="610"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt; What We Deserve, the third and final
                part of Telltale's &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/the-walking-dead-michonne/"&gt;The Walking Dead:
                Michonne&lt;/a&gt;, will be out on April 26. Ahead of that, Telltale has put up
                another “Your Choices” video that reveals some of the decisions players made as
                they worked their way through the previous episode. It's about as pleasant as
                you'd expect, and be warned: There are many spoilers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As it
                turns out, Michonne&amp;mdash;which is to say, &lt;em&gt;you, &lt;/em&gt;you
                blood-soaked monsters&amp;mdash;has both a talent and a taste for the ugly
                business of killing. Which isn't really all that surprising, I suppose, given
                that The Walking Dead as a whole isn't exactly known as the sort of fictional
                world in which people like to sit down and talk things out. Still, you try to do
                what's right... Right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “In 'What We Deserve,' feeling the
                weight of choices both recent and long ago, Michonne tries to protect an
                innocent family... but Norma and the vengeful Monroe crew are closing in,”
                Telltale explained. “As reality shatters and the ghosts of the daughters she
                abandoned demand to be heard, your choices will determine who lives, who dies,
                and what redemption really means in a world gone to hell.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My
                prediction: Nobody lives, everybody dies, and redemption is a cold, dreamless
                void spat from the barrel of a gun. Find out more at &lt;a

            <description>With 15-minute matches and a 1v1 setup,Dropzone has a couple
                interesting twists on the MOBA and RTS formats.

                &lt;iframe width="560" height="315"
                src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f4TZZX-396k" frameborder="0"
                allowfullscreen=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like plenty of real-time strategy
                diehards, I'm not a fan of MOBAs. So when I was invited to check
                out&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://playdropzone.com/"&gt;Dropzone&lt;/a&gt;, game
                claiming to be part RTS and part MOBA, I was curious but skeptical. That
                skepticism softened when I learned the developer, Sparkypants Studios, was made
                up of many of the old Big Huge Games team that created the stellar RTS &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/reinstall-rise-of-nations/"&gt;Rise of
                Nations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dropzone, uniquely, is a 1v1 strategy game
                where each player controls three units. Like an RTS, the characters under your
                control can work as a group or be branched off to different objectives, but the
                maps are smaller, and you control the abilities of the group as a single entity,
                like a MOBA. And like both genres, Dropzone places a heavy emphasis on map
                awareness and avoiding tunnel vision in pursuit of a single
                objective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Company president Jason Coleman said the team
                brainstormed a few ideas for its first game and felt it should focus on its
                strength. “We started looking at MOBAs, and considered a game derived from an
                RTS,” he said. “We wanted to strip out the base-building for accessibility and
                focus on competitive team play, but we found that it could be difficult to
                follow for new spectators and was missing the deep skill of split
                attention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The team refined its approach to focus on
                creating a 1v1-only game that retained the team fight dynamics in MOBAs, but
                made the player focus their attention on the map and responding quickly to
                various events. They gave each match a set length, with easy to learn rules and
                victory conditions so a spectator can pick it up
                quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img

                alt="12121"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As I sat down to play Dropzone, I was worried
                I wouldn't be able to follow because I didn't understand the units and didn’t
                have deep knowledge of MOBA strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To my surprise,
                before the 15-minute match was complete, I found myself cheering when a map
                point was saved, or a key defensive maneuver that changed momentum, while
                appreciating the use of an opportune heal or special ability. I understood what
                was happening as a spectator before anything was explained to me
                in-depth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Part of this is due to the simple
                setup&amp;mdash;Dropzone isn’t a game of a hundred characters. Players build a
                team of three characters from five classes. Right now, tank, gunner and mechanic
                are the only classes revealed. The setting is futuristic sci-fi, so the
                characters pilot mech-like ‘rigs,’ with the tank there to soak up damage, the
                gunner as dishing out DPS, and the mechanic supporting. There are, however,
                different variations of each class based on the character. For example Widget
                and Turbine are both mechanic characters, but Widget has a better heal than
                Turbine does. But all the characters can be customized with various loadouts
                that have been unlocked during previous play sessions. So if you want more
                firepower, you can build a gunner loadout that focuses on area of effect and
                higher DPS. If you want more crowd control from a mechanic, you can build a
                loadout that freezes units in place or slows them down. That flexibility is
                welcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dropzone’s format is equally straightforward: get as
                many points as possible before the 15-minute time limit expires, with ties going
                to sudden death. To score points, you have to destroy alien hives at static
                positions around the map, pickup the cores that they drop, and upload them at
                the center of the map. The premise my sound simplistic, but when the action
                started, it proved to be very intense as I tried to stay ahead of my opponent
                either by uploading cores, or destroying his rigs and grabbing his cores to
                upload.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img
                data-fullimage-src="http://36646d87786feafc0611-0338bbbce19fc98919c6293def4c5554.r0.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/wKmCLMUASl2k.png"
                src="http://36646d87786feafc0611-0338bbbce19fc98919c6293def4c5554.r0.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/SYuuvtn4VkF9.878x0.Z-Z96KYq.jpg"
                alt="9 Pilot Lineup 04 16"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As you’d expect, characters
                level up over the course of a match. The minor twist is that you have to choose
                which character to allocate that level to. All experience is pooled, so if your
                tank has a cool ability that unlocks at level 4, you can focus on him, while
                your other characters stay at level 1. It definitely made for some interesting
                choices. In one game I maxed out my gunner to level five to unlock his super DPS
                ability. In another I got my mechanic to level 4 first so he had a better heal.
                Each time I played, I tried to refine my tactics and adapt to how my opponent
                was leveling their units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The hives respawn after a short
                time, but with more AI defenders and hit points. For having such simple
                mechanics, Dropzone gives you a lot of stuff to keep tabs on. You get experience
                from killing hives and uploading cores, but you can also go for different
                objectives, like controlling all vision towers around the map for two points, or
                killing 10 sergeant aliens for four points. It kept the game at a frenetic pace,
                knowing I only had 15 minutes to get as many points as possible, and I had to
                figure out the most efficient way to do it while keeping my opponent in
                check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some of the devs have mastered dividing their team up
                to take on three separate objectives at once, while memorizing the hotkeys for
                each of the various special abilities that a character has. When I started, I
                kept my team together at all times and rarely used anything other than the basic
                attack. But before the day was done, and more than 30 matches under my belt
                against devs and the AI, I was actually starting to master the hotkeys and
                dividing my team up. And I understood the need for total map awareness, as the
                vision towers were important to see what my opponent was up
                to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img
                data-fullimage-src="http://ec0c5a7f741a6f3bff65-dd07187202f57fa404a8f047da2bcff5.r85.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/2ETSNzDoR5yx.png"

                alt="MechanicII"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The overall experience really wore me
                out, but in a good way. It reminded me of the fast and furious nature of some of
                the best RTS matches I had seen in esports, which is something Sparkypants
                intended. The competitive nature of the 1v1 action was highlighted by the daily
                game among the devs. Each day at the studio, two members of the team square off
                against each other with the match shown on a big screen in the company lounge
                where the rest of the team observes, comments and takes notes on possible
                changes and refinements. During play, I found myself cheering at the timing of a
                good heal or a core upload just before a rig was destroyed. Not only was this
                multiplayer action that needed little explanation, it was really entertaining to
                watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dropzone will be a free-to-play title, but Coleman
                insists everything will be unlockable through play. and while the game won’t
                ship with a lot of maps or unit abilities, Sparkypants plans on regualr updates
                to bring more heroes, skills and maps to the game. I admit that I’m always
                skeptical when I hear free-to-play because it ends up more often than not being
                pay to win. But after playing through Dropzone for several hours, I found the
                game had enough in it that kept me interested and going back for
                more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As an RTS player nervous about MOBAs, I felt like
                Dropzone had enough strategic gameplay that I could overlook the MOBA elements.
                I joked to Sparkypants that Dropzone did feel more like a MOBA to me. Coleman
                laughed, saying that MOBA players felt it played more like an RTS. “So we must
                be doing something right if we are appealing to both sets of players.”&lt;/p&gt;

                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/mirrors-edge-catalyst-closed-beta-dated-social-play-detailed/"&gt;a
                few days away&lt;/a&gt;, and the game itself will be out in a little over a
                month. And that means it's time to start thinking about whether or not your
                trusty PC will be able to actually run it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As revealed earlier
                today at the official &lt;a
                href="http://www.mirrorsedge.com/news/pc-system-requirements"&gt;Mirror's Edge
                website&lt;/a&gt;, here's what you need to know about what you'll need to
                have:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MINIMUM:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;OS:
                Windows 7 64-Bit (use the latest Service Pack) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;CPU: Intel
                i3-3250 / AMD FX-6350. (Note: Mirror's Edge Catalyst requires at least 4 logical
                cores to run.) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RAM: 6 GB &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hard Drive:
                At least 25 GB of free space &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Video: Nvidia GeForce GTX 650
                Ti 2GB or better / AMD Radeon R9 270x or better &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Input:
                Keyboard and mouse, dual analog controller
                &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RECOMMENDED:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;OS:
                Windows 10 64-Bit (use the latest Service Pack) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;CPU: Intel
                Core i7-3770 at 3.4 GHz / AMD FX-8350 at 4.0 GHz &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RAM: 16 GB
                &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hard drive: At least 25 GB of free space
                &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Video: Nvidia GeForce GTX 970 4GB or better / AMD Radeon R9
                280x 3GB or better &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Input: Keyboard and mouse, dual analog
                controller &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naturally, you'll want to ensure that
                your video drivers are up to date as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As is the way of
                things, EA gave no suggestion as to what sort of performance you can expect at
                either end of the spectrum. The recommended spec is definitely up there, though,
                so hopefully it will translate into a flat-out spectacular experience. Mirror's
                Edge Catalyst comes out on May 24. &lt;/p&gt;

                data-fullimage-src="http://ec0c5a7f741a6f3bff65-dd07187202f57fa404a8f047da2bcff5.r85.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/UvabSaluSR-X.jpg"

                alt="Twilight Struggle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Twilight Struggle, once called
                "the best boardgame on the planet" by&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
                href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/designing-the-best-board-game-on-the-planet/"&gt;FiveThirtyEight.com&lt;/a&gt;
                with only mild hyperbole, is the king of period-specific historical boardgames.
                With two players competing as the respective leaders of the United States and
                the Soviet Union, Twilight Struggle at once captures the broad themes of Cold
                War competition as well as the specific moments that defined the ideological
                deathmatch. After years as the darling of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
                href="https://boardgamegeek.com/"&gt;BoardGameGeek&lt;/a&gt;, XCOM: Enemy Within
                designer Ananda Gupta's tabletop masterpiece&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
                href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/406290/"&gt;has finally been adapted to
                PC by Playdek&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At heart, Twilight Struggle is about
                influence: who can bring more countries into their sphere of influence and
                dominate the strategic no-man's land between East and West. The genius here is
                that rather than being weighed&amp;nbsp;down with abstract systems and resources
                to simulate the Cold War, Twilight Struggle uses history itself to drive the
                action. Almost every major event and personality of the Cold War has a playing
                card associated with it, and the two sides trade rounds playing cards from their
                hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;All this bluffing and lateral thinking is what
                makes Twilight Struggle a great boardgame.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; The catch
                is that some events favor the other side, but you'll still need to do something
                with them if they end up in your hand. You might have no choice but to play a
                bad event in order to use those operations points&amp;hellip; even if that
                causes the event to trigger and hurt your cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That might
                be a cost worth paying, because in Twilight Struggle, timing is everything. This
                weekend I was playing a game as the Americans and, in the late 1950s, I got a
                bad deal. I received both the European and Middle Eastern scoring cards, which
                meant that I had to play those cards and score those regions before the end of
                the turn. But I also had a lot of bad cards in my hand that harmed me in both
                regions. I had one advantage: I knew those two regions were scoring this turn,
                and my opponent did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;img
                data-fullimage-src="http://0cb8dd5d2dc142d08f0f-eb3b436d25971e5860b39e72b0600342.r94.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/Vn-y4gNNR4SU.jpg"

                alt="Twilight Struggle" style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial,
                sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I started the turn with the&amp;nbsp;East
                European Unrest card, which eliminated Soviet control over Poland, Eastern
                Germany, and Czechoslovakia. My next card scored the region when my enemy was at
                his weakest. I dominated the region and the key battleground states, which
                tilted the game hard in my direction. Then I noticed my opponent making
                aggressive moves in Asia: he triggered the Korean War, and launched a coup in
                Malaysia to break my hold over it. His single-mindedness tipped me off that he
                was probably about to score the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Which suited my
                purposes, because he ignored the fact that I used my Marshall Plan card in the
                Middle East rather than Europe to take over Iran and Saudi Arabia. Then I used
                the de Gaulle card to launch a coup in Iraq, which chased the Soviets out of the
                region entirely while costing me a (now useless) position in France. That coup
                also brought the game to DEFCON 2, which meant that nobody could launch any more
                coups without triggering nuclear war. By the time the dust cleared, I'd
                dominated Europe and the Middle East and denied my opponent a major victory in
                Asia, despite having a hand full of Soviet cards that should have sunk
                me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All this bluffing and lateral thinking is what makes
                Twilight Struggle a great boardgame, but boardgames aren't always easy to bring
                over to PC. Fortunately, Playdek's adaptation does a terrific job of both
                nailing the basics and also providing just enough enhancements and effects that
                Twilight Struggle on PC captures not only the core rules and mechanics of the
                game, but the experience of playing the boardgame itself. That's true even
                playing it single-player against a capable, if slightly slow-moving, AI
                opponent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;img
                data-fullimage-src="http://ec0c5a7f741a6f3bff65-dd07187202f57fa404a8f047da2bcff5.r85.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/aP9lfMX1T9Wk.jpg"

                alt="Twilight Struggle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's chock-full of thoughtful
                touches: as you play, little meters in each region let you see
                at&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;glance where the balance of power currently sits between
                the Soviets and the United States. Each action you take changes what the
                contextual help button will tell you, so you can always get a refresher on the
                relevant rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While I recommend turning the music off, I
                loved the sound effects that accompanied the game. It reminded me a bit of
                Introversion's superb DEFCON (though perhaps not quite as eerily evocative). As
                you play, the changing eras are marked with a distorted audio recording of a
                famous American or Soviet leader. You'll hear aircraft flying overhead, cheering
                patriotic crowds, and the loud wail of air-raid sirens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I
                think what I like best is that Twilight Struggle embraces the convenience of the
                electronic format without taking away the tactile satisfaction of playing with
                chits&amp;nbsp;and cards. It lets you see and experiment with different
                possibilities without ever giving your opponent a clue about what you're up to
                or upsetting the board. It enforces its rules with a light hand, always allowing
                you second thoughts in light of new information. It even taught me a minor rule
                that I've been misapplying for years with a helpful bit of subtle
                highlighting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;img

                alt="Twilight Struggle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This weekend I was mostly playing
                intense one-on-one games that lasted an hour or so, which is about a third the
                length of a typical Twilight Struggle game if you include time spent
                setting&amp;nbsp;up the board. The matchmaking is flexible. You can create a
                game to be played over a few hours or a few days or even a couple weeks by
                giving each player a period of hours or days in which to make all of their
                moves. So even though the clock is always ticking when it's your turn, you can
                still play asynchronously just by allowing each player more time to complete
                their game. I even played it in the same room with a friend, laptop-to-laptop,
                and realized that it's just as fun and a lot more convenient than busting out
                the boardgame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Twilight Struggle's&amp;nbsp;creativity and
                elegance sets it apart from most of what's available on PC. It's a great
                strategy game, but one that behaves according to completely different logic than
                we're used to seeing. As a strategy game, Twilight Struggle is a revelation. On
                PC, it's one of the best head-to-head strategy games around.&lt;/p&gt;

                alt="Whispers of the Old Gods"&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The tentacle-y influence
                of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.pcgamer.com/hearthstone/"
                target="_blank"&gt;Hearthstone's&lt;/a&gt; next card expansion,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/next-hearthstone-set-revealed-all-players-get-three-free-packs-and-a-legendary/"
                target="_blank"&gt;Whispers of the Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;, is nearly upon us. The
                set will&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/blog/20097936"
                target="_blank"&gt;launch next Tuesday,&amp;nbsp;April 26th&lt;/a&gt;, and add a
                total of 134 new cards to the game&amp;mdash;about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/every-hearthstone-whispers-of-the-old-gods-card-revealed-so-far/"
                target="_blank"&gt;70 of which have been revealed so far&lt;/a&gt;. Similar to
                Hearthstone's previous expansions, we can probably expect to see all the
                remaining cards revealed at once sometime later this week.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt; The arrival of Whispers of the Old Gods will also mark the
                introduction of formats in Hearthstone. Ranked play will be split into Standard
                and Wild: Standard only allowing Basic and Classic cards, along with cards from
                any set released in the last two calendar years, while Wild will be the
                equivalent of Hearthstone as we know it now. Blizzard has also said that there
                will be a&amp;nbsp;wave of nerfs to some of the more oppressive cards in the
                Basic and Classic sets (I'm looking at you, &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/does-hearthstones-druid-combo-need-to-be-nerfed/"&gt;Druid
                combo&lt;/a&gt;) but we still don't know exactly what those nerfs will
                be.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/hearthstones-ben-brode-on-old-gods-and-reynads-match-making-theory/"
                target="_blank"&gt;We spoke to Lead Designer Ben Brode&lt;/a&gt; about the
                coming changes, formats, and the Whispers of the Old Gods late last month.
                &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Despite wanting to tune older cards,&amp;nbsp;Blizzard
                clearly&amp;nbsp;isn't afraid to introduce&amp;nbsp;some pretty ridiculous (and
                potentially powerful)&amp;nbsp;card effects with this expansion, especially when
                it comes to the set's four Old God legendary minions.&amp;nbsp;Tim was very
                excited about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/hearthstones-latest-old-god-will-bring-back-your-deathrattle-minions/"
                target="_blank"&gt;N'Zoth, The Corruptor&lt;/a&gt;, who resummons
                all&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;your&amp;nbsp;Deathrattle minions who died in the
                current&amp;nbsp;game and could make for some insane swing&amp;nbsp;turns.
                Meanwhile, I was more interested in the somewhat sillier&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
                href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/33168-yogg-saron-hopes-end"
                target="_blank"&gt;Yogg-Saron, Hope's End&lt;/a&gt;, which plays a random spell
                with a random target for every spell you've played that game&amp;mdash;probably
                not a very good card, but it sure will be a fun one.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt; In a change from previous expansions, every player will be given three
                Old Gods card packs completely free, along with one of the set's &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/what-the-hearthstone-pros-think-of-cthun/"&gt;more
                unique legendary minions, C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;. Blizzard is also bringing back the
                pre-order offer they introduced with Hearthstone's last big expansion, The Grand
                Tournament, allowing you to buy 50 card packs (and an exclusive card back) for
                $50. Or, you can just farm gold with the rest of us. &lt;/p&gt;

                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/bastion-review/"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/transistor-review/"&gt;Transistor&lt;/a&gt;, has
                announced that its next game is a party-based RPG called &lt;a
                href="http://www.supergiantgames.com/blog/first-look-at-our-third-game-pyre/"&gt;Pyre&lt;/a&gt;,
                in which you'll “lead a band of exiles through an ancient competition spread
                across a vast, mystical purgatory.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The game opens with your
                rescue by a band of masked wanderers, who then enlist your aid on their quest to
                discover the truth about the Rites, “a secretive competition through which the
                worthiest exiles can return home, absolved of their transgressions.” Along the
                way, you'll meet various other competitors, learn their stories, and ultimately
                help to determine who will be absolved, and who will remain in
                exile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Pyre once again showcases our team's commitment to
                rich atmospheric presentation and storytelling, along with a distinctive
                gameplay blend that combines expressive decision-making on the world map with
                fast, action-packed confrontations against rival groups of exiles whose own
                freedom is at stake,” Supergiant wrote. “We want to create a large cast of
                characters you can grow close to as you travel together across a strange and
                wondrous land.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The trailer and screens are awfully pretty,
                and even though it's not the most concise description of a videogame ever, the
                setup is intriguing too. Pyre is currently slated to come out sometime in 2017.

                alt="446020 20160419153813 1" style="background-color:
                initial;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s the year 1990, the Berlin Wall has fallen,
                and you’ve just come into possession of a Laika 601 Deluxe.&amp;nbsp;This
                beat-up old car goes from 0-60 in 22.5 seconds and has a top speed of 100kmph.
                It’s not exactly a powerhouse, and it’s constantly in danger of breaking down,
                but it’s all you and your uncle have to get across Germany. As far as premises
                for games go, this is pretty unique. Jalopy hits Steam Early Access next week,
                but I’ve been given the chance to take this charming old rust-bucket for an
                early test drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But before I can hit the road, I have to
                build it. At the beginning of the game the car sits in my uncle’s driveway, a
                shell with no wheels or inside bits to make it go. I believe that’s the
                technical term. I replace a missing door, which naturally has a different colour
                of paint. Then I grab various parts from around the
                garage&amp;mdash;carburettor, fuel tank, ignition coil, engine,
                battery&amp;mdash;to bring the beast to life. And as I do my uncle explains what
                they all do. The bold, stylised art is striking, with a muted colour palette
                that perfectly captures the era and setting. There’s a nice physicality to
                grabbing the objects and slotting them into the car too. When I’m done, it’s
                time to go on a very peculiar road trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I noticed as I fitted
                the engine that each part had a durability rating. Jalopy is something of a
                survival simulator, except you aren’t managing your hunger and tiredness; you’re
                trying to keep your dilapidated old car alive. Weight is also an issue, and the
                speed the Laika moves depends on the weight of the parts I use and whatever I
                have in the trunk. There’s an impressive amount of simulation, even down to the
                lever you have to yank under the steering wheel to pop the hood. The entire game
                revolves around the car, and I can see myself getting attached to the little
                wreck as I spend time tinkering with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img

                alt="446020 20160419161058 2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Laika has a two-stroke
                engine, which means I have to pour oil into the fuel mixture as I juice her up.
                If I don’t the engine won’t be lubricated and will wear out at an increased
                rate. But if I put too much oil in I’ll see a performance drop. It’s all about
                the balance. I’m learning more about two-stroke engines and ancient old
                automobiles playing Jalopy than I have in my entire life. Developer Greg
                Pryjmachuk previously worked on Formula 1 racing games, so it’s clear he loves
                cars on deeper level than just driving them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the car my
                uncle points out a few useful items. There’s a maintenance manual that will
                instruct me how to repair the car when it inevitably breaks down, and there’s a
                map that will let me select a route through the country. When I do the game will
                procedurally generate a landscape that I’ll then be able to drive across. In the
                manual I learn that the Laika is named after the stray dog the Soviet Union
                launched into space in 1957. “Your new car, with its distinguished name, shall
                forever be a faithful companion to you.” reads a piece of introductory text with
                a slightly propagandist tone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first section of my journey
                is driving from Berlin to Dresden, which is a distance of 210 kilometres. I
                stick the keys in the ignition, fire up the Laika, and soon I’m leaving my
                uncle’s garage and speeding down the Autobahn towards Dresden. I can hear the
                two-stroke engine heaving and groaning as I drive along and I wonder how long
                it’s going to hold out. I see other cars on the road, war memorials, and a lot
                of trees. There’s no in-game music, so I fire up a Spotify playlist of late ‘80s
                music to enhance the atmosphere. ‘Looking for Freedom’ by David Hasselhoff seems
                appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img
                data-fullimage-src="http://0cb8dd5d2dc142d08f0f-eb3b436d25971e5860b39e72b0600342.r94.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/8R3LTMpkSWGe.png"

                alt="446020 20160419161519 1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the simulation of
                the car itself is fairly deep, the driving model doesn’t seem to have much
                nuance to it. If you’re used to the weighty feel of something like Euro Truck
                Simulator, you might be disappointed. But I get the feeling the driving isn’t
                really the focus in Jalopy. It’s more about keeping your car running, making
                money by trading and delivering goods, and there appears to be a storyline
                involving your uncle returning to his hometown that I didn’t get much of a taste
                of in this very early build.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mind begins to wander, then
                suddenly I smash into another car. I notice a small amount of smoke belching
                from the hood of the Laika and I know I’ve done something terrible. My uncle
                tells me to stop whenever it’s safe to do so and I splutter along looking for a
                place to make repairs. Eventually I reach a town and I stop in a motel car park.
                Luckily I put a repair kit in the trunk back at the garage and I use it to
                repair the busted engine. Satisfied, we decide to stay at the motel for the
                night and continue our journey the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except I can’t,
                because in this press build the game ends as soon as I go to sleep. Lucky,
                really, because as I was attempting to unlock the motel room door with the key,
                I accidentally dropped my wallet and passport and they disappeared into the
                ground. Driving around the former Eastern Bloc without a passport seems like a
                very bad idea. Alas, I won’t find out what happens until a more complete build
                of the game is released. Jalopy is one of the weirdest games I’ve played in some
                time, but also one of the most fascinating. I’m looking forward to learning more
                about the political situation in that part of the world in the early ‘90s, if I
                can avoid smashing into other drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

                heart, there are still a few devs out there who haven't forgotten us. Elder
                Games is&amp;nbsp;working on a sequel to&amp;nbsp;2014's&amp;nbsp;&lt;a

                New World&lt;/a&gt;. Meridian: Squad 22 hits Early Access May
                30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's solid sci-fi fare: Earth's first batch of colonists
                have gone missing, so an elite group of soldiers are dispatched to find out
                what's going on. This being an RTS, I'm doubtful that the colonists have made
                peaceful first contact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img

                sounds like a considerable improvement over its predecessor. You can zoom and
                rotate for one thing. More impressively, models and textures are brand new,
                pathfinding ought to have been improved no end, with units now accelerating and
                decelerating based on their proximity to others, and naval combat has been
                introduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding Early Access, Elder Games is planning to
                keep things snappy. In terms of units and technology, Squad 22 is reportedly
                close to completion, so Early Access is pegged to be a 10-week feedback and
                bug-squashing&amp;nbsp;period. What do you think? Worth a
                punt?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If news of Meridian has left you curious about the state

            <content:encoded>

                &lt;p&gt;The Logitech G810 is the third keyboard in Logitech’s lineup to use its
                own proprietary Romer-G switch. It trims off some features and flair from the
                flagship G910 to bring the price down a notch and appeal to the masses. Focusing
                keenly on gaming, the G810 has incredible aesthetic appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div
                class="fancy-box"&gt;&lt;h5 class="title"&gt;At a
                Glance&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First
                class:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Dedicated media keys; volume scroll wheel is a
                god send;&amp;nbsp;Romer-G switch is very fast and tactile; quiet; uniform
                backlight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cattle
                car:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Shorter key travel may not be for everyone; very
                prone to accidental keystrokes; pricy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don’t
                normally delve too deep into the technology behind the keyboard’s switches, but
                since the G810’s Romer-G switch is one of a kind, it has a few note-worthy
                highlights that deserve some extra ink. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Romer-G switch
                spawned from a partnership between Logitech and the Japanese switch manufacturer
                Omron. It’s designed to be an extremely fast, gaming-oriented switch while still
                retaining a degree of tactile feedback. To achieve this, the Romer-G is set to
                actuate at 1.5mm with just 45g of force. A surface mounted LEDs sits in the
                center of the switch, something Cherry lacked for a long time until just
                recently. Another advantage of Romer-G is its redundant contacts. It has two
                separate sets of copper contact plates to register every
                keystroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="" style="display: block; margin:
                auto;"
                data-fullimage-src="http://36646d87786feafc0611-0338bbbce19fc98919c6293def4c5554.r0.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/UlqSDwlxSyud.jpg"
                src="http://e5c351ecddc2f880ef72-57d6ff1fc59ab172ec418789d348b0c1.r69.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/zFfhpm-uqX8d.878x0.Z-Z96KYq.jpg"
                alt="Logitech G810 Orion Spectrum 4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Romer-G has a
                distinct feel that sits at the mid-ground between Cherry MX Red and Cherry MX
                Brown switches. Its key travel becomes smooth and consistent after the tactile
                point. The travel distance is very shallow, which helps its rebound speed. It’s
                also relatively quiet when bottomed out; our sound meter showed 75dB at the
                source and 63dB at around 50cm away. For the sake of comparison, the Cherry MX
                Blue, the loudest of Cherry MX switches, hit 85dB at the source and 70dB from
                50cm away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While gaming, the Romer-G is like a jumpy rabbit
                after ten shots of espresso. Thanks to its high actuation point and light
                actuation force, the Romer-G is lightning fast and effortless to press. While
                this undoubtedly gives you an edge in spam-intensive games, its sensitive nature
                also causes it to fire with the slightest pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
                Romer-G’s short key travel is a hit or miss for typing. If you’re used to rubber
                membrane switches, you should be right at home with the Romer-G. If you’re
                coming from a Cherry MX or Kailh-based keyboard however, it does take a little
                getting used to. The keys feel like they’re dampened when bottomed out,
                softening the feedback to our fragile joints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re not too
                fond of Logitech’s decision to use Cherry stabilizers instead of Costar for a
                premium product. With that said, the G810’s Cherry stabilizers are actually
                quite nice. Key travel is consistent, responsive, and smooth. There was none of
                that “mushiness” Cherry stabilizers are infamous for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img
                data-fullimage-src="http://36646d87786feafc0611-0338bbbce19fc98919c6293def4c5554.r0.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/86lfuMpeRpy1.jpg"
                src="http://36646d87786feafc0611-0338bbbce19fc98919c6293def4c5554.r0.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/AizN1P9wU7bD.878x0.Z-Z96KYq.jpg"
                alt="Logitech G810 Orion Spectrum 8" style="display: block; margin: auto;"
                class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The G810 does not support n-key rollover (NKRO).
                Should this bother you? Not really. (That is, unless you have more fingers than
                there are letters in the alphabet.) Keystrokes only start to skip if more than
                27 keys are pressed simultaneously. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The G810 uses a tough
                plastic casing to house its important switches. It withstood flexes and shakes,
                but we could do without its glossy side bezels. The keycaps are nothing fancy:
                they're just laser engraved ABS keycaps that are a dime a
                dozen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dedicated media control buttons is tucked away in the
                top right corner. A “gaming mode” button turns the Windows key off when gaming.
                One thing we can’t get enough of is the convenience of the volume adjust wheel.
                It’s easy to access, feels great to use, and melts seamlessly into the
                chassis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img
                data-fullimage-src="http://36646d87786feafc0611-0338bbbce19fc98919c6293def4c5554.r0.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/4lKbfOGqQCeC.jpg"
                src="http://0cb8dd5d2dc142d08f0f-eb3b436d25971e5860b39e72b0600342.r94.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/PBf59m-7aR9N.878x0.Z-Z96KYq.jpg"
                alt="Logitech G810 Orion Spectrum 3" style="display: block; margin: auto;"
                class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To keep the keyboard stable on the desk, the G810
                comes with six of the largest rubber feet we’ve ever seen. The multi-level
                elevator feet is also a nice touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Logitech G810 really
                turns up its charm once it’s plugged in. The keyboard's surface-mounted LEDs
                illuminates the key printing evenly and brilliantly. All of the keys, including
                the dedicated media keys, have one installed underneath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To
                adjust the backlight pattern (among other things), there’s the Logitech Gaming
                Software. Lighting effects include breathing, wave, and keypress. For the
                creative (or obsessive-compulsive) individuals out there, you can program a
                unique color for each key. Upon first installation, the Logitech Gaming Software
                will detect what games you have installed and display the key bindings for each
                game. While we didn’t find them to be too much of help, we did like the included
                macro manager to re-program the function row.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img
                data-fullimage-src="http://ec0c5a7f741a6f3bff65-dd07187202f57fa404a8f047da2bcff5.r85.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/yWG20e2hRi-e.jpg"
                src="http://e5c351ecddc2f880ef72-57d6ff1fc59ab172ec418789d348b0c1.r69.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/X0rGaDN5cfol.878x0.Z-Z96KYq.jpg"
                alt="Logitech Gaming Software 1" style="display: block; margin: auto;"
                class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anything proprietary is going to cost you a
                pretty penny. Tipping the scale at $160, the G810 positions itself in the higher
                end price category. Whether it’s worth your hard-earned cash has a lot to do
                with personal preference. In our eyes, the G810 with its Romer-G switch is a
                toss-up. We like its responsiveness for gaming, but we prefer a deeper travel
                for typing. Speaking from a utilitarian perspective, it’s hard to push aside our
                beloved Cherry MX keyboard in favor of the Logitech G810. With that said,
                Logitech set out to create a &lt;em&gt;gaming&lt;/em&gt; switch, and the Romer-G
                certainly lives up to the expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

                no simple rehash of the Italian mobster theme. From October 7, you'll be heading
                down to New Bordeaux&amp;mdash;Hangar 13' take on 1968&amp;nbsp;New
                Oreleans&amp;mdash;as&amp;nbsp;Vietnam vet Lincoln Clay. The black mob who took
                him under their wing have been wiped out by the Mafia, and thus begins a good,
                honest revenge trip. Well, not honest&amp;mdash;you're repurposing a crime
                empire as your own&amp;mdash;but definitely a revenge
                trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trailer hits the beats of the late '60s beautifully
                (get a load of those faces!), and it looks like Hangar 13&amp;nbsp;won't be
                afraid to dabble in fraught politics of race relations. The criminal underworld
                demands you balance the loyalties of Irish, Haitian and rebel Italian gangs.

            <category>The Banner Saga 2</category>
            <content:encoded>

                &lt;p&gt; Time continues washing over us, says The Banner Saga 2’s narrator as
                the story starts up again. It’s an apt metaphor for the plight of your surviving
                leader, with a caravan’s worth of followers in real danger of drowning beneath
                an unforgiving tide that’s sweeping ever closer. If that wasn’t bad enough,
                hidden currents also lie in wait, ready to drag them under; these terrible
                circumstances are the kind that force good people into morally murky waters,
                making decisions that could easily see history paint them as the bad
                guy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="fancy-box"&gt; &lt;h5 class="title"&gt;NEED TO
                KNOW&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;What is it?&lt;/strong&gt;
                Bleaker-than-Threads narrative-led turn-based strategy.&lt;br&gt;
                &lt;strong&gt;Publisher&lt;/strong&gt; Versus Evil&lt;br&gt;
                &lt;strong&gt;Developer&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Stoic Studio&lt;br&gt;

                href="http://stoicstudio.com/"&gt;Official site&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like its predecessor, The Banner Saga 2 is a game that
                dares to make the struggle to survive feel perilously close to futile. It
                invites you to do what you can to keep your people alive, even in the knowledge
                that it might not&amp;mdash;and, in all likelihood, probably won’t&amp;mdash;be
                enough. That in itself is a gauntlet being thrown down, a challenge to players
                to succeed against shattering odds&amp;mdash;or at least to delay defeat as long
                as possible. But its greatest triumph is to invest you so deeply in a decaying
                world and its inhabitants that, no matter how bad things get, you want the
                journey to continue. The scenery is a huge draw, but you’ll want your cast to
                live long enough to see the same magnificent sights, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If
                anything, the canvas is even more sprawling than before. The starkly beautiful
                setting seems to make you feel smaller than ever&amp;mdash;at times, you’ll find
                yourself peering into the background at what looks like a tiny swarm of ants
                scuttling across the screen. If you weren’t already sure of your place in the
                world, these sequences makes you acutely aware of just how vulnerable your
                exhausted band really is. As before, the funereal trudge of your cortège
                cleverly captures both the sensation of time passing and the prevailing feeling
                of despair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world is visibly breaking, and your caravan
                is no different. Departures come more frequently, as allies choose alternative
                paths, and others bid a more tragic farewell. More significantly, your choices,
                however well intentioned, cause rifts within the camp. Conflict grows
                organically from the decisions you actively make and those that are
                unceremoniously thrust upon you - with one exception, as an agonising late game
                dilemma leads you to face a former ally on the battlefield. This is high stakes,
                high drama stuff, but a rare moment of contrivance, too, with the ramifications
                of your choice not becoming clear until it’s too late. It’s powerful, but
                manipulatively so; manufactured, seemingly, to increase the emotional weight of
                your eventual choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;img
                data-fullimage-src="http://4d663a369f9f03c3c61e-870e77779efd63f7bd6c2ee08d8cfae6.r2.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/Gc22oP_9QkWj.jpg"
                src="http://e5c351ecddc2f880ef72-57d6ff1fc59ab172ec418789d348b0c1.r69.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/uL1xl-duUwXN.878x0.Z-Z96KYq.jpg"
                alt="Banner saga 2 1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is, however, a small misstep on
                a tense, gripping and pitiless journey. The pervasive threat of the armoured
                Dredge on your tail is a constant menace that pushes you into pressing on even
                as legs, hearts and minds are giving out. But can you afford to hang back to
                accommodate the stragglers, or do you abandon them to their fate for the good of
                the rest? Some of the options here are troublingly dark, and raise questions of
                whether survival is really worth the loss of humanity&amp;mdash;or, in a few
                cases, sanity. Even before a delirious trek through a strange forest, people are
                clearly losing their grip. Then again, the mercurial Tryggvi’s gnomic mutterings
                could equally be a sign of disturbing foresight. Then there’s ragged slaughterer
                Bak, carrying the thousand-yard stare of a man who’s seen far too much for one
                lifetime, and who clings onto his beloved spear just a little too tightly for
                comfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If grief and madness reign among this first group,
                the second party you command is powered by rage and confusion. As the Ravens, a
                mercenary group introduced at the climax of the first game, forge their own
                route towards the human capital of Arberrang, their hulking Varl leader Bolverk
                experiences increasingly potent visions that threaten to undermine his iron
                fisted rule. The narrative cleverly interweaves the stories of both groups, with
                characters and motifs recurring in both threads. There’s some weighty thematic
                material here, too: the introduction of a third race, the horseborn, allows
                Stoic to touch upon ideas of intolerance and xenophobia in a resonant and
                relevant fashion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; The second party you command is
                powered by rage and confusion. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; While this might all
                sound a little too self-consciously solemn, The Banner Saga 2 takes itself
                seriously in all the right ways. And though it’s a shade or so darker than its
                predecessor, there are more instances of dry humour sprinkled throughout.
                There’s no risk of it turning into The Banter Saga, though these exchanges will
                likely raise a smile or two. Maybe it’s a by-product of the ubiquitous gloom,
                but moments of light relief such as these and the odd unexpected act of kindness
                are as moving in their own way as the death of a favourite character. The
                ability to laugh in the face of fear and adversity proves a powerful expression
                of the human spirit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The need to marshal a growing cast means
                that some characters, inevitably, get shorter shrift. In some cases, that’s
                simply because you’ve not used them often in battle, or spoken to them outside
                it, and so their act of unlikely heroism falls flat. Otherwise, it’s simply that
                Stoic hasn’t quite given everyone enough time to shine: one unexpected loss
                arrives a little too soon to have the desired impact. Perhaps, however, that’s
                part of the plan; certainly, it’s a reminder that death can come swiftly and
                suddenly, and that no one should be considered off limits when it’s time for the
                Grim Reaper’s scythe to descend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;img
                data-fullimage-src="http://4d663a369f9f03c3c61e-870e77779efd63f7bd6c2ee08d8cfae6.r2.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/R4klXKdNS0un.jpg"
                src="http://ec0c5a7f741a6f3bff65-dd07187202f57fa404a8f047da2bcff5.r85.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/eCfCP_fIQI9b.878x0.Z-Z96KYq.jpg"
                alt="Banner Saga 2 2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stoic’s storytelling is more
                sure-footed, then, and so too are the strategic systems that power its
                turn-based skirmishes. There’s more variety in the encounters here, and
                narrative elements are more skilfully woven in. You might begin the battle with
                a series of hastily constructed barriers thanks to an astute choice beforehand.
                Later, you’ll be asked to quickly clear a path while a wave of Dredge advances
                on your position. Another mission invites you to keep a single unit protected
                for as long as possible, and there are further variations besides. None of this
                fundamentally affects how it plays, but contextual adjustments make for a
                pleasant change from simply killing everything to win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New
                characters and new classes give you a much wider array of tactical options, some
                of which can produce devastating combinations, assuming you can keep the
                relevant units alive long enough to pull them off. The poet Aleo’s active
                ability buffs characters to add a unit of damage for each two units of strength
                their opponent has above theirs; as such, you can motivate a wounded ally to
                take an almighty swing at a particularly powerful enemy for huge damage. And if
                it’s a killing blow, it’ll trigger his passive for any friendly units in the
                vicinity, for a small but possibly crucial boost to their finite supply of
                Willpower, used to enhance the potency of any attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                Bolverk, meanwhile, can always count upon faithful shieldmaiden Folka. Put her
                by his side in battle and she’ll give him a defensive boost, but his
                untrammelled fury means she might get the odd whack from his twin axes - though
                that second random swing might just take another chunk out of the strength bar
                of his opposite number. Alternatively, you could choose to surround Bak with
                allies to give him close to a 100 per cent chance of a double-damage critical
                hit. Specialised training exercises encourage you to learn how to make best use
                of these new characters and their abilities, and you’ll earn bonus renown for
                completing all objectives. Slaying opponents here also contributes to your kill
                count, giving you the chance to promote weaker units without forcing them into
                crucial fights before they’re ready.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;img
                data-fullimage-src="http://0cb8dd5d2dc142d08f0f-eb3b436d25971e5860b39e72b0600342.r94.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/-952ZIVxRQ28.jpg"
                src="http://e5c351ecddc2f880ef72-57d6ff1fc59ab172ec418789d348b0c1.r69.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/_GelRQfHPJ2v.878x0.Z-Z96KYq.jpg"
                alt="Banner Saga 2 3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though it takes a while for them to
                arrive, the Horseborn add an extra strategic wrinkle with their ability to move
                after attacking&amp;mdash;letting you gallop forward, land a blow and then
                retreat to a position of relative security. Assuming you can find one, that is.
                With javelin throwers, archers, Horseborn and Dredge throwing magic
                grenades&amp;mdash;not to mention the insidious little hatchlings that turn
                invisible until you bump into them&amp;mdash;there are very few spaces where
                you’re entirely safe from harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, even the more
                expansive battlegrounds can get cramped and visually messy, particularly when
                you factor corpses into the equation. There’s still no option to rotate the
                display to get a better angle. Zooming in or out can sometimes help, but
                otherwise you’ll have to either examine the turn order at the bottom of the
                screen to see who you’re targeting or squint. It’s disappointing that such an
                obvious flaw from the first game hasn’t been fixed; likewise that established
                rules aren’t always applied consistently. Injured parties that would ordinarily
                be forced to rest for several days will miraculously be up for selection in the
                next battle if the plot demands their availability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You’ll
                forgive the occasions where the narrative and mechanics don’t always dovetail
                perfectly for the moments in which they do&amp;mdash;spectacularly so during one
                story beat, as Stoic somehow generates nerve-fraying tension from a sequence
                conducted at walking pace. Yes, there’s still room for improvement, but this is
                a smart, worthy sequel: denser, richer, more complex and yet more intimate. Even
                if you’ll feel in dire need of a stiff drink once this second act draws to its
                devastating close.&lt;/p&gt;

                alt="Mafia 3 hero"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m sitting down at a table with the
                three lieutenants helping me maintain my growing hold on New Bordeaux, Mafia
                III’s marvelous recreation of 1968 New Orleans. I’ve just finished the climactic
                mission in my bid to take down an Italian-run construction fraud racket. It was
                a delightful spree of organised carnage, starting with slow, quiet infiltration
                by way of a stolen mob vehicle and an underground car park, before rapidly
                escalating via an elevator to a hotel penthouse containing seemingly half of the
                local mob. And a showdown with their rocket launcher toting ringleader. And then
                I took his rocket launcher and fought my way out through the front lobby. It
                wasn’t neat, is what I’m saying. It got quite hectic. But this meeting right
                here, this is far more stressful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In front of me are Burke,
                Vito, and Cassandra. Between them, they respectively run the Irish, rebel
                Italian, and Haitian gangs. Each time I pry ownership of a new enterprise from
                the dominant Italian Mafia, I need to hand it off to one of the three to run on
                my behalf. I’m going to be far too busy causing a mess elsewhere. But good Lord,
                do they get precious about it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Neglect any lieutenant for
                too long, and they’re going to get angry, convinced that I’m screwing them over
                and tipping the balance of power in favour of one of the other two gangs. The
                problem is, sometimes I have to. Sometimes the perks delivered by one lieutenant
                in exchange for a hand-out will be &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what I need at
                the time, be they new weapons, increased fire support on missions, better health
                recovery, or anything else from the raft of bonuses that come with long-term
                loyalty. Sometimes I can’t be fair. This is one of those times.
                &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I hand the territory to the already-flush Cassandra, and
                Burke goes ballistic. Vito is pissed too, and his upset cuts deep as he compares
                me unfavourably to long lost friends from Mafia II&amp;mdash;Vito was that
                game’s protagonist, and goddamnit I wish I was giving him a happier
                retirement&amp;mdash;but the Irish boss is definitely the biggest problem. He
                tells me that this is my last chance. He tells me that if I screw him one more
                time, it’s all over. Although developer Hangar 13 is keeping very quiet about
                what this means, I strongly suspect that I might soon be dealing with more than
                one enemy faction if I’m not careful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img

                alt="Mafia 3 2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This vignette, placing the weight of real
                leadership on my shoulders after the high of a deliciously free-form killing
                spree, is typical of Mafia III. Because Mafia III has fleshed out its
                predecessor's rather spartan open-world not with extraneous distractions and
                miscellaneous malarky, but with constant options, choices, and responsibility.
                &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Take the construction racket, for instance. That hotel
                assault was just the cherry-bomb on the cake. To get to that point, I had to
                weaken the entire organisation, reducing its income bit by bit, until I could
                make the big push. The means Mafia III offers to do so present a Matryoshka doll
                of possibilities within possibilities, each certain to reduce the mob’s finances
                by a certain percentage of a target sum, and each open to tackle in any way I
                choose. Or not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can take down supply trucks, either on the
                road as part of madcap driving battle&amp;mdash;targeting wheels and petrol
                tanks at will&amp;mdash;or by tracking them down when parked up at mob sites,
                casually rolling a grenade beneath before sauntering off. I can attack
                lower-level enforcers wherever they might conduct their professional activities,
                fighting through their goons before bumping them off, or aggressively recruiting
                them for my own empire. I can take a bigger risk by hitting a more secure
                location, assaulting a major, multi-tiered building site packed with dozens of
                well-armed mooks. That means a large-scale attack, but I’m free to use any
                approach, from a full-ghost stealth run to bringing in extra muscle and a
                boatload of guns after a couple of quick phone calls to my seconds-in-command
                (if they’re still talking to me). Or I can just take the direct approach, and
                quietly lift a large pile of cash while its owners are busy filling a building’s
                foundations with fresh corpses. Maybe I’ll toss a molotov while they’re
                distracted by business, maybe I’ll just vanish on the breeze.
                &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The important thing to know is that none of these activities
                are side-quests. Hangar 13 is at pains to emphasise that everything you do in
                Mafia III pushes you forward. Everything is part of the core narrative, the new
                structure simply in place to deliver a greater sense of player authorship by way
                of a wider path to the end goal. That’s very welcome news to those of us who
                feared that the previous game’s nuanced, affecting, genuinely mature
                storytelling thrust might be drowned amid a push for minigames and nonsense
                diversions. Mafia’s new developer really seems to understand what makes the
                series special, and is building part three around the same key pillars of
                grown-up, character-driven story, sparkling historical detail, and smooth,
                snappy action. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img
                data-fullimage-src="http://4d663a369f9f03c3c61e-870e77779efd63f7bd6c2ee08d8cfae6.r2.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/S_d9aKQaR3Gv.jpg"
                src="http://36646d87786feafc0611-0338bbbce19fc98919c6293def4c5554.r0.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/EFOKqTpZTKGx.878x0.Z-Z96KYq.jpg"
                alt="Mafia 3 3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That latter element is particularly
                apparent in Mafia’s newly malleable combat. With a satisfyingly gluey
                cover-system underpinning everything, both shooting and stealth feel tactile and
                robust. But most crucially, Mafia III gets the transition between play-styles
                just right. Gunplay never feels like the consolation prize for screwing up
                stealth. Sneaking never feels like the coward’s way out of a tough gunfight.
                &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’s all tremendously organic and rewarding, with sudden
                shifts in the action state eliciting genuine excitement rather than a swift
                click toward a checkpoint reset. You’ll dash from the gleeful crack-pop of one
                Mafia’s terribly enjoyable headshots to a close-up melee execution, and then
                seamlessly slink back into cover to clear another group out with a grenade. And
                then use the resulting disarray to vanish among crates and drywall to mop up
                with a more cat-and-mouse approach. Each disparate strategy feels more than just
                viable. It feels like the only right thing to do at the moment you execute it.
                &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As for the series’ trademark sense of time and place, it
                feels like we could be in for a pretty special iteration this time around. Mafia
                III’s version of&amp;nbsp;New-Orleans is evoked with both gloss and grit, a
                lazy, hazy, summertime heat permeating its streets just as bullets and
                foul-mouthed slurs fill the air. Speaking of which, new protagonist Lincoln Clay
                could well prove a worthy successor to Vito. A mixed-race member of the Black
                Mafia, and a Vietnam veteran by the time the game starts, he’s a clear microcosm
                for all of the era’s major social and political concerns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                Going off current evidence, the game’s tone seems to pull no punches, but
                neither is Lincoln placed on a pedestal of virtue. Tricky waters for a AAA
                action game to navigate in 2016, but then, Mafia has always been a more
                thoughtful breed of open-worlder. Bigger, and perhaps slightly brawnier, Mafia
                III nonetheless very clearly carries that defining family trait.&lt;/p&gt;

                target="_blank"&gt;Runescape&lt;/a&gt; which isn't shaded strictly in primary
                colours to be witchcraft. The news that Runescape now has a standalone client,
                another round of graphical improvements and is moving away from Java is rank
                heresy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From today, anybody can download and play Runescape
                NXT, an all-new engine and client released as part of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a

                target="_blank"&gt;Runescape's 15th anniversary&lt;/a&gt;. The view distance has
                been quadrupled, dynamic lighting and shadows have arrived, as has real-time
                reflection, refraction,&amp;nbsp;ambient occlusion and physically correct light
                scattering. They're the basics of your average PC game, but in Runescape? I'm
                not ready for this&amp;nbsp;futuristic&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future
                development will see&amp;nbsp;normal maps, higher-resolution&amp;nbsp;textures,
                volumetric lighting and a better animation system introduced. In keeping with
                some of Runescape's original spirit, however, it'll still run on everything back
                to Windows XP.&lt;/p&gt;

                two sequels,&amp;nbsp;Dark Souls still has a bustling community and the long

                Dark Souls 3 multiplayer, others suspect a conspiracy to drive more players to
                the new release, but Bandai Namco is silent on the issue. The

                console-centric titles like Ratchet and Clank, Resistance and Sunset Overdrive,
                will release its 2D Metroidvania on Steam in July. As James discovered when

                alt="Dark Souls 3 Review (25)"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're as utterly
                consumed by&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.pcgamer.com/dark-souls-3"&gt;Dark
                Souls 3&lt;/a&gt; as I am, then even the most mundane patch notes are likely to
                have you furrowing your brows. Bandai Namco has announced an imminent 1.04 patch
                to roll out tomorrow, and while it's not a huge update, you'd best have a look
                in case one of your favourite weapons is affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are
                the changes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Performance update for the
                Greatsword&lt;br&gt;- Battle performance adjustment for Dancer's Enchanted Sword
                and Winged Knight's Twinaxes&lt;br&gt;- Performance adjustment for Soul's
                Greatsword and Farron's Flashsword&lt;br&gt;- Fix for issue where multiple items
                become impossible to use at Road of Sacrifices, Farron Keep and Cathedral of the
                Deep after finishing the game.&lt;br&gt;- General adjustments and bug
                fixes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the patch notes – which can be perused
                when booting up the game – fail to mention what the performance updates and
                adjustments entail. More disappointing is that the notes don't make reference to
                an especially hairy bug that has hit PC players, resulting in a crash when
                some&amp;nbsp;users try to sit at the Firelink Shrine bonfire.

                workaround over here&lt;/a&gt;, but hopefully an official fix will come
                soon.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt; The CPU may be the brain of your PC, but when it comes to gaming, the
                graphics card is the beating heart that pumps pixels out of your obelisk of a
                tower and into your monitor. A graphics card consists of dedicated video memory
                and a graphics processing unit (GPU) that handles all sorts of calculations,
                like mapping textures and rendering millions of polygons. Simply put, the
                graphics card is the most vital component of your gaming PC. And these are the
                ones worthy of your next PC, whether it's a savvy middle-of-the-road build, a
                budget rig, or a 4K monster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-left: 40px;"&gt; &lt;a

                out this week's best graphics card
                deals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update
                4/18/2016:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;Little has changed since
                late 2015 in terms of hardware, and we are waiting for new GPUs from Nvidia and
                AMD. Indications are both companies plan to &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/nvidia-pascal-rumors-point-to-three-gp104-gpus-in-june/"&gt;launch
                new products around June&lt;/a&gt;, but there are always future products in the
                works.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em style="background-color:
                initial;"&gt;For most users, our recommendation is to wait until Polaris and
                Pascal arrive, but f&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;or those who can't wait, we've updated
                product links to select better priced cards.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
                &lt;h3&gt;The best graphics card&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nvidia introduced both the
                GTX 980 and &lt;a
                href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NN0GEXQ/?tag=pcgedit-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=bestgpu"&gt;the
                GTX 970&lt;/a&gt; in early September 2014, primarily focusing on the 980’s
                killer performance and impressively low power consumption. But the Nvidia
                GeForce GTX 970 is the more important card: it’s priced closer to Nvidia’s
                typical mid-range graphics, and despite the memory brouhaha, it's close to the
                980 when it comes to performance. Of course it's now slated to be replaced with
                Pascal, but until Pascal arrives, we can only speculate on what will
                be&amp;mdash;not what is. And right now, this is the best gaming
                card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At a &lt;a
                href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7744002/type/dlg/http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814127833"
                target="_blank"&gt;starting price of $290&lt;/a&gt; (~£248), the GTX 970 offers
                4GB of GDDR5 VRAM, 1664 CUDA cores, and a base clock of 1050MHz. That may not
                sound incredibly fast, but the GTX 970’s base clock leaves tons of room for
                overclocking, and its boost clock can pass the 1400MHz mark. Also, keep in mind
                these are the default specs; most cards from EVGA, Gigabyte, MSI, etc. come
                factory overclocked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt; A direct spec comparison
                between the GTX 970 and older Nvidia hardware isn’t going to show you exactly
                how fast this card is. Because of improvements in Nvidia’s new Maxwell
                architecture, the card is nearly as fast as the 780 Ti, which launched at $700.
                Nvidia has made architectural improvements with Maxwell that make its graphics
                processing more efficient, especially at higher resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                According to Nvidia, each CUDA core in the 900 series is 40% more efficient,
                which explains why the 970 can go toe-to-toe with the 780 Ti, which has 2880
                CUDA cores to the 970’s 1664. Improved color compression helps performance at
                high resolutions, and the 970’s performance-per-watt is dramatically better than
                700 series cards&amp;mdash;or the AMD competition. Testing puts system power
                draw while gaming with a GTX 970 and i7-6700K at 260 watts, while competitors
                like the AMD R9 390 draw closer to 325 watts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img
                data-fullimage-src="http://4d663a369f9f03c3c61e-870e77779efd63f7bd6c2ee08d8cfae6.r2.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/JjjCSYIiSFG1.jpg"
                src="http://0cb8dd5d2dc142d08f0f-eb3b436d25971e5860b39e72b0600342.r94.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/Vegu9coKAbzz.878x0.Z-Z96KYq.jpg"
                alt="Evga Gtx 970"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course it's not just about power
                draw. In general, AMD's R9 390 is slightly faster while using more power, but it
                also costs more. Toss in Nvidia's better track record with putting out new
                drivers&amp;mdash;particularly Game Ready drivers just before major game
                launches&amp;mdash;and the GTX 970 ends up punching above its weight class. Now
                add in GeForce Experience, a quick one-stop solution for selecting optimal
                quality settings for your hardware, and ShadowPlay, which is a fantastic way to
                capture video footage or stream straight to Twitch, and we basically seal the
                deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not all sunshine and roses, however. The 4GB VRAM
                on the GTX 970 is segmented into a 3.5GB and 0.5GB partition, with that final
                0.5GB performing slower. &lt;a target="_blank"
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/why-nvidias-gtx-970-slows-down-using-more-than-35gb-vram/"&gt;You
                can read more about these problems here.&lt;/a&gt; This problem doesn't usually
                come up, however, as the settings where the 970 runs well don't typically
                require all 4GB VRAM. If a game ends up in a situation where it's running out of
                memory performance, the solution is to drop one or two settings a
                notch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fact remains that the GTX 970's overall
                performance is fantastic for the price. It's not the card we recommend for 4K
                gaming or extreme performance&amp;mdash;we'll get to that card in a moment. But
                for most gamers, we still think this is the best value
                available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you’re convinced, there’s only one question
                left: which GTX 970 do you buy? Nvidia ships its cards to companies like ASUS,
                EVGA, Gigabyte, MSI, and Zotac, which install their own coolers on the cards and
                sometimes overclock them before selling them to consumers. Sometimes the
                companies even make their own custom PCB (printed circuit board), as is the case
                with &lt;a target="_blank"
                href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7744002/type/dlg/http:/www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814121912"&gt;ASUS's
                mini 970&lt;/a&gt;. The good news is that all these companies get the same
                parts, so performance won’t vary wildly from one to another, which means the
                largest differentiating factor is often the price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img
                data-fullimage-src="http://e5c351ecddc2f880ef72-57d6ff1fc59ab172ec418789d348b0c1.r69.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/-H-hI_2iRpKx.jpg"

                alt="Msi Gtx 970 Graphics Card"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now, the least
                expensive GTX 970 goes for $290 ($280 after the $10 mail-in rebate), and that's
                the MSI GeForce GTX 970 4GD5T OC. It comes slightly overclocked at 1102MHz base,
                but you can push that quite a bit further if needed. (Note that you'll often run
                into the power limit of 145W before you max out the card, which would require
                VBIOS modding if you want to go further.) It's a great card that runs quiet, and
                it's much cheaper than &lt;a target="_blank"
                href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;amp;field-keywords=gtx+970"&gt;other
                970 options&lt;/a&gt; sitting at $315+ on Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fact
                is, we haven't tested any GTX 970 that we'd actually rate as a bad card or
                something you should avoid. If you don't want to overclock on your own, the more
                expensive cards often come with larger overclocks and more robust coolers, but
                you can usually get 95 percent (or more) of their performance with little to no
                effort using any GTX 970. Here's a list GTX 970 cards to consider, in order of
                pricing; note that many Nvidia cards include a copy of The Division for free
                right now (check your reseller; Newegg definitely has coupons):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p

                GTX 970&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The best AMD graphics
                card&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; We understand there are some users who prefer to use
                something other than an Nvidia card. While the GTX 970 gets our primary
                recommendation, this particular spot is as close to a tie as we're likely to
                see. From Team Red, aka AMD, the Radeon R9 390 is a beastly card that usually
                beats the GTX 970 in performance&amp;hellip;but it requires more power and a
                larger card to get there, plus about $30 extra. Hence, the virtual
                tie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Amazingly, the R9 390 is based on the existing Hawaii
                architecture, which debuted back in October, 2013. There are faster cards from
                both teams now, but the GCN architecture is alive and well, and there are &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/ashes-of-the-singularity-beta-2/"&gt;indications
                DX12 games&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;when and if they start showing up in
                quantity&amp;mdash;will run significantly better on the 390 compared to the GTX
                970; hell, it even beats the &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/ashes-of-the-singularity-beta-2/3/"&gt;GTX 980 in
                Ashes of the Singularity&lt;/a&gt;. The 390 takes the former R9 290 and doubles
                the memory and pushes the RAM clocks from 5GHz to 6GHz, with a slight increase
                in core clocks as well. It's a card that should be capable of mainstream and
                high-end gaming for several more years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt; But which
                R9 390 should you buy? Several months ago, prices dropped below $300, but these
                days the R9 390 is sitting back at $325 ($305 after a mail-in rebate, if you go
                for those). XFX has the distinction of being &lt;a target="_blank"
                href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7744002/type/dlg/http:/www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814150729"&gt;the
                least expensive 390&lt;/a&gt;, though the 15MHz core overclock is nothing
                special. End-user overclocking is also pretty limited, usually around eight
                percent max before you start getting artifacts. Even so, you can comfortably run
                most games at 2560x1440 with maxed out&amp;mdash;or nearly
                so&amp;mdash;settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The downsides are the reverse of what
                we said with the GTX 970. The R9 390 guzzles as much power as a GTX 980 Ti while
                providing less performance&amp;mdash;GCN simply isn't as efficient as Maxwell.
                You'll also need both a 6-pin and an 8-pin power connector (or on some cards,
                two 8-pin connectors), and plenty of room in your case, as the R9 390 is a very
                large card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the other hand, there's none of the 3.5GB
                shenanigans that you'd get with a GTX 970; no sir, you get a full 8GB of GDDR5
                memory here! And while load power of 250W might sound scary, when you're just
                surfing the web or doing mundane office tasks, the 390 is within a few watts of
                most other GPUs. AMD has alternatives to most of Nvidia's features as well,
                e.g., FreeSync instead of G-Sync, but you do miss out on HDMI 2.0
                compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you're looking for a DX12 card to keep you
                going until the 14/16nm updates launch, the R9 390 is a great option. One final
                caveat to note is that Bitcoin/cryptocurrency fever has pushed AMD GPU prices
                higher than expected of late, so many R9 series GPUs are out of stock. Since the
                primary differentiator is price, here’s a list or R9 390 cards (in order of
                price at the time of writing); note that most of the Newegg offerings also

                best high-end graphics card for 4K&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you're looking for
                more than a GTX 970 or R9 390, chances are you're also running a 4K
                display&amp;mdash;or at least a QHD display that can do more than 60Hz. It's
                possible to run games at 4K on our primary pick, but many titles will only run
                smoothly with medium or even low quality settings. If you want to do it
                properly, you’re going to need a hell of a graphics card. We always advocate
                getting the best single-GPU solution for gaming when possible, and that’s why
                our recommendation for the best high-end graphics card is the Nvidia 980
                Ti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wait, what about the &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/nvidia-titan-x-review-2015/"&gt;GTX Titan
                X&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;isn't it a faster card? You would think so, and in some
                cases it is, but throughout a large suite of gaming benchmarks, we've never seen
                more than a three percent difference between the 980 Ti and the Titan X. Half
                the VRAM doesn't really matter when few games use more than 4GB, let along 6GB,
                and both GPUs end up hitting power and bandwidth limits at around the same
                point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you want to game at 4K with a single GPU, the 980
                Ti saves you money and provides nearly identical performance. That makes it the
                better graphics card for almost any sane person, and it still has an impressive
                6GB GDDR5 with a 384-bit memory interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt; AMD's
                closest competition is the R9 Fury X, which costs about the same but includes a
                closed loop liquid cooling solution. That might sound good, but it makes running
                multiple Fury X cards a pain, and in practice Nvidia still leads on
                performance&amp;mdash;not to mention the same things we noted on the GTX 970,
                like drivers, GeForce Experience, and ShadowPlay, all still apply here as
                well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you need more than that, the GTX 980 Ti cards we've
                tested all overclock like champions, often by more than 20 percent over stock.
                Prices have also fallen since the 980 Ti launched, to the point where the &lt;a

                href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7744002/type/dlg/http:/www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814127895"&gt;980
                Ti can be had for as little as $580&lt;/a&gt; ($550 after mail-in rebate right
                now). And if you really want to go all-out, &lt;a target="_blank"
                href="http://www.maximumpc.com/nvidia-gtx-980-ti-2-way-sli-crushing-performance/"&gt;add

                two!&lt;/a&gt;) for some eye-searing SLI performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of
                course, there's a reason for the price cuts. With 14/16nm FinFET cards slated to
                show up in the next couple of months, if you didn't jump on the 980 Ti bandwagon
                last summer, you're probably late to the party now. We don't know precisely what
                Pascal and Polaris will offer compared to 980 Ti, but we've seen the
                professional GP100 version of Pascal, and a mainstream GP104 card should prove
                equally compelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other GTX 980 Ti cards to

                980 Ti&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The best budget graphics
                card&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 970 and 390 are awesome graphics cards at around the
                $300 mark, so it's hard to recommend something slower unless the price is truly
                remarkable. Basically, the $200-$250 range gets absorbed from either above and
                below. That means we want a great card for less than $200, and the R9 380 4GB is
                the perfect card for this spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're worried that buying
                a budget graphics cards will mean sacrificing image quality, let's be clear: we
                still want good performance at 1080p, and we’re willing to pay a bit more for
                that privilege. If you’re okay with medium quality and you don’t want to spend
                more than $100, we have one final pick below; we’re gunning for high quality
                1080p at around 60FPS (and on slightly older titles, 2560x1440 at medium to high
                quality is often possible).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt; The R9 380 is an
                update to last year's R9 285, with a few minor tweaks to clock speeds. Both
                cards use the Tonga GPU core, with some optimizations to deliver similar
                performance to the R9 280/280X at a lower price. The one change with the R9 380
                is that 4GB cards are more readily available, and we strongly recommend going
                that route&amp;mdash;there are quite a few games where 2GB VRAM will
                fundamentally limit what is otherwise a strong GPU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The
                competition from Nvidia consists of the GTX 950 and GTX 960, the latter of which
                has a 4GB model but is more commonly shipped with 2GB VRAM. The least expensive
                4GB GTX 960 tips the scales at $190 ($170 after mail-in rebate), which is
                identical to the R9 380 price, but AMD has a slight lead in overall performance.
                In many ways, this is a reprise of our above choice between the GTX 970 and the
                R9 390, only with less disparity in price, performance, and power use. 2GB cards
                meanwhile drop about 10 percent in performance on our test suite, and about $20
                in price, so they're not completely out of the question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                Nvidia still has the advantage in drivers and other features&amp;mdash;with
                similar caveats about DX12&amp;mdash;but it's mostly a wash&amp;hellip;unless
                you want to overclock. Nvidia's cards typically hit 20 percent overclocks,
                compared to 10 percent with AMD, so hardware enthusiasts may gravitate more
                toward Nvidia. Keep in mind that none of the sub-$200 cards are VR ready, which
                makes sense considering the VR kits cost $600+.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p

                card&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know where you’re coming from: $600 for a graphics
                card is fantasy land, $300 is way too much, and even $180 would break the bank.
                How about something closer to $100? Why yes, we can go that low. To be clear,
                there’s compromise involved. You’re not going to be gunning for 1080p at high
                quality at this price point, but 1080p at medium quality should be doable in
                most games, or you can dig into your backlog of games and play titles from a few
                years ago at higher quality settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s some good news,
                however, like the fact that the Zotac GTX 750 Ti we’ve selected doesn’t require
                any form of external power. If you have a PCIe x16 slot on your system, you
                should be able to plop in the 750 Ti and start gaming. The card pulls all of its
                whopping sub-75W power over the PCIe slot, which means cooling isn’t much of a
                problem either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt; We’re aiming pretty far down the
                totem pole at this point, so where the top card has 2880 CUDA cores and an
                entry-level GTX 960 still packs 1024 cores, the 750 Ti only has 640 cores. These
                are Maxwell 1.0 cores as well (GM107 if you prefer), which means you lose some
                of the newer features like lossless delta color compression. It's still
                technically a DX12 part, but we're skeptical that will prove of much use on
                these cards. Thankfully, it’s going to be way faster than any integrated
                graphics chip, and you get all of this along with 2GB GDDR5 memory for
                $105.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While we're here talking about the GTX 750 Ti, it's
                also important to note that for just $20 more, you can now find GTX 950 2GB
                cards that don't require a 6-pin power connection. Those cards use the newer
                Maxwell 2.0 architecture, and unless you absolutely can't spend the extra $20,
                they're definitely worth considering. Of course, once you go up to $120, it's
                only another $25 jump to 4GB cards, and so on; hence, we've elected to draw the
                line at $105.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you’re hoping to go under $100, we have to
                advise caution. Yes, there are cards available, but many of them start cutting
                so many features that you’re only going to end up slightly faster than a modern
                APU like AMD’s A10-7800. Maybe you have an older CPU, though, in which case you
                could pick up something like a &lt;a target="_blank"

                240 2GB&lt;/a&gt;, but at that point you’re &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; scraping
                the bottom of the barrel. Do yourself a favor and try to save up for at least a
                $100-class graphics card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-left: 40px;"&gt; &lt;a

                performance&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Games are rarely bottlenecked by your CPU, but
                dozens of games every year will push your graphics card to its limits. It's the
                component you'll want to upgrade most frequently (though if you buy the right
                card, it should last you at least two years). For gaming systems, it's also
                likely the most expensive part in your build. On a practical budget, it's
                critical to find the graphics card with the best ratio of price to performance.
                That's why our recommendation for the best graphics card remains the Nvidia
                GeForce GTX 970.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At $290 (~£203), Nvidia's GTX 970 is a killer
                card, outperforming older cards that initially cost twice as much. It's
                overclockable, quiet, and efficient; more importantly, it's able to run most
                recent games at 60 frames per second, 1080p, and usually ultra settings. It's
                the best card for the price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GTX 970 is the card we'd
                recommend to most&amp;mdash;but not all&amp;mdash;PC gamers. Maybe you don't
                care for Nvidia or their overwhelming market share, or maybe you've got cash to
                burn, and need a card that can run games at 4K resolution. Perhaps you're trying
                to build a dirt-cheap gaming PC and you can't with an even cheaper graphics
                card. Our graphics card guide includes six picks covering the entire market,
                from ultra-budget to budget, and mainstream to high-end gaming
                PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing graphics
                cards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our graphics card recommendations are
                based on our own benchmarks and testing, as well as research into the reviews
                and testing done by other sites. Along with Maximum PC, we have benchmark data
                for a range of Nvidia and AMD graphics cards, including the GTX 900 series,
                Nvidia 700 series, AMD R9 300 series, and the R9 Fury/Nano
                cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes the best graphics card? For PC gamers, it's
                a balance of price and performance. The graphics card must be able to run
                demanding games at high framerates and settings, with 1920x1080 being the most
                common resolution. However, we also test at 2560x1440 and 4K, which are becoming
                increasingly popular choices, particularly at the high-end. The best graphics
                card shouldn't cost more than other cards with comparable performance, and the
                card should be fast enough to still perform respectably two years later, even if
                it can't run everything at max settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graphics performance
                isn't the only consideration. The quality of game drivers and other software
                features supported by the card are important. The card's noise level, power draw
                and temperature matter, too. Thankfully, nearly all of the cards run fairly
                quiet, even under load, and temperatures are within the acceptable range as
                well&amp;mdash;though Nvidia generally has an advantage in both power and
                temperature levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a high level, we tested each card on
                a high-end PC (4.2GHz overclocked i7-5930K), at 1080p, 1440p, and 4K with Ultra
                settings at the lower resolutions and Ultra or High at 4K. We included results
                from eight games, some newer and some slightly older: Batman: Arkham Origins,
                Fallout 4, GTAV, Hitman: Absolution, Metro: Last Light, Middle-Earth: Shadow of
                Mordor, Rise of the Tomb Raider, Tomb Raider 2013, and The Witcher 3. Here's how
                they stack up in terms of average and minimum frame rates across these
                games:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img

                alt="Overall performance gpus - april 2016"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We selected
                the Nvidia GTX 970 as the best graphics card for most gamers after benchmarking
                all of the latest GPUs and comparing the numbers&amp;mdash;including power
                requirements, noise, and performance. With the next generation of GPUs slated to
                launch around June, we've eliminated older cards from our list&amp;mdash;only
                the GTX 750 Ti is left, and solely as an ultra-budget
                option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future
                testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The computer graphics world is a
                fast-changing field, and we've already had a preview of what Nvidia's &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/nvidia-pascal-p100-architecture-deep-dive/"&gt;next-generation
                Pascal architecture&lt;/a&gt; will offer at the &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/gtc2016/"&gt;2016 GPU Technology
                Conference&lt;/a&gt;, and AMD has previously stated &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/amds-polaris-shoots-for-the-stars/"&gt;Polaris will
                launch around June&lt;/a&gt; as well. Given the pending release of consumer
                Pascal cards, we expect prices on existing cards to continue to slide,
                particularly at the top&amp;mdash;the GTX 980 Ti used to be a solid $650, for
                example. We could see some dramatic price cuts once new hardware shows up, as
                Nvidia and AMD are always out to one-up each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But until
                Pascal and Polaris arrive, we can only speculate on how they'll perform. If you
                didn't jump on the GTX 970 or Hawaii&amp;nbsp;bandwagon already, there's little
                need to rush into it now. The R9 390 and GTX&amp;nbsp;970 are great cards, but
                after five years stuck at 28nm manufacturing, the GPU companies are finally
                getting the long-awaited process shrink. Stay tuned, as June and July could
                radically alter the graphics landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A note on

                width="610"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rebellion announced in February that
                &lt;a href="http://www.pcgamer.com/battlezone-98-redux"&gt;Battlezone 98
                Redux&lt;/a&gt;, a remake of the hit FPS/RTS hybrid that was originally released
                in 1998, was in the works and would be out &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/rebellion-reveals-battlezone-98-redux/"&gt;in the
                spring&lt;/a&gt;. And “the spring,” as it turns out, is
                today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The redo, developed by Big Boat Interactive, offers
                two single-player campaigns&amp;mdash;one American, one Soviet&amp;mdash;with
                updated graphics including “completely remodeled vehicles and buildings,
                enhanced lighting and shadows, improved particle effects, upgraded animations,
                upscaled terrain, and more.” There are also Deathmatch and Strategy multiplayer
                modes for 2-8 players, support for mods through the Steam Workshop, and a
                built-in map editor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rebellion didn't explain why it released
                the game with basically zero fanfare, but it did put out a launch trailer
                showcasing the improvements and additions, and it also showed off the new
                gameplay in a livestreamed lead-up to the announcement &lt;a

                Twitch&lt;/a&gt;. To make up for the lack of a preorder period, it's also got
                the game on sale &lt;a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/301650"&gt;on
                Steam&lt;/a&gt; for $16/£12, a 20 percent discount on the regular price until

                width="610"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can't say for certain why we didn't
                review Rambo: The Videogame around these parts, although I suspect the fact that
                it was pretty awful may have been the deciding factor. The PC version rocks a 34
                aggregate score &lt;a
                href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/rambo-the-video-game/critic-reviews"&gt;on
                Metacritic&lt;/a&gt;, which is actually ahead of the Xbox 360 edition (28) and
                the PS3 (23, yowch). Despite that, and the fact that it came out more than two
                years ago, a new DLC expansion called Baker Team will be released for the game
                tomorrow. At this point I like to imagine at least a couple of you tying
                bandannas on in expectation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Baker Team is an original Rambo
                story that takes place during his Green Beret days in the Vietnam War, in which
                our titular hero, along with Barry, Messner, and Danforth, must undertake three
                dangerous missions deep inside enemy territory. The DLC will add new weapons,
                perks, and achievements, as well as a&amp;nbsp;higher level cap and a new “John
                Rambo” difficulty setting, for players who think Green Beret toughness just
                isn't tough enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In case there was any question (because
                there probably should be), Jaspreet Singh Marwaha, a marketer and “design
                contributor” on the game, said &lt;a
                href="https://twitter.com/JasSMarwaha/status/722109285551992832"&gt;on
                Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that this is not a joke. "There were some problems, finally
                got them all approved and we felt that we owed it to everyone that wanted it,"
                he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Baker Team expansion will be free, while the
                game itself remains at $13/£10 &lt;a

            <description>Final Fantasy IX is the best PC port of a classic Final Fantasy
                yet, though its pre-rendered backgrounds suffer at high resolutions.</description>

                alt="Ff9 Thumb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I still have a little trouble
                believing&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/final-fantasy-ix-released-for-pc/"&gt;Final Fantasy
                IX on PC is real&lt;/a&gt;, even as I play it. Unlike Square's other PlayStation
                1 Final Fantasys, IX never got a PC port back in 2000. The company's archival
                practices in the PlayStation era were notoriously spotty, and as years went by
                and (nearly) every other game in the series showed up on mobile and PC, a modern
                port of IX seemed less and less likely. But here it is&amp;mdash;and given what
                they had to work with, Square Enix and Silicon Studio Thailand have built a
                surprisingly good PC port of Final Fantasy IX, which could easily become a great
                one with a couple patches and help from modders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Feature
                check&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;FFIX's PC port includes most of the basics of a modern
                Steam release: achievements, trading cards, controller support in addition to
                keyboard/mouse controls, and cloud saving. But a couple of these are strangely
                implemented. Instead of using Steam Cloud and syncing data across systems
                automatically, the game has a built-in upload/download tool for a single save
                file. Locally, you can save up to 140 files across 10 "slots" that seem like
                memory card holdovers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Controller support has two issues. One:
                when using a controller, there's no true analog movement, but rather slightly
                awkward 8-directional movement. My guess is this is a result of how the game was
                ported to support WASD controls. Two: when starting FFIX with a controller
                already active, a bug causes a constant input in a single direction, making the
                game unplayable. This is easily fixed by launching the game first and then
                plugging in the controller. These controller bugs should be fairly easy for
                Square Enix to fix with an official patch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img
                data-fullimage-src="http://4d663a369f9f03c3c61e-870e77779efd63f7bd6c2ee08d8cfae6.r2.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/J9AgieuLTsCI.png"

                class=""&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;The cloud save system is slightly strange, but it
                gets the job done.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The keyboard and
                mouse controls in FFIX are surprisingly comprehensive. Unlike many PC ports of
                older console games that don't support mouse in the menus, the mouse controls
                here can do everything. You can navigate menus, select actions in combat, and
                even navigate the environment point-and-click style. Sounds weird for a JRPG,
                but it works surprisingly well.&amp;nbsp;This includes clicking on the "!"
                bubbles that pop up to talk to characters. Pro tip: the jump rope minigame is
                &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; easier with mouseclick than with a button
                input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keyboard controls accept movement on both the arrow
                keys and WASD, and the same buttons can be remapped on both keyboard and
                controller: Confirm, cancel, menu, cards, camera rotation, fix camera,
                perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of all this, Square added some optional
                "boosters" to the recent mobile port&amp;nbsp;of FFIX that are the same in this
                version. Note that the controls for these are not customizable through the
                game's config menu. The boosters are: 9999 damage, no random encounters, full
                battle meters, auto attack, fast forward (entire game runs at much higher
                speed), level/stone max (hit level 99), gil max. Note that the last three here
                are irreversible choices, while the first three can be enabled/disabled from the
                pause menu or in battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Graphics and
                presentation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;PlayStation games mostly ran at a resolution of
                320x240 pixels, with a few special cases running as high as 640x480. This is
                obviously a huge problem for a game like FFIX, which mixes 3D models,
                pre-rendered video backgrounds, and FMV sequences. How do you render all of
                these things at modern PC resolutions? The answer in this case is: you don't.
                Square has done a fantastic job with the 3D models and FMV, but the pre-rendered
                backgrounds suffer tremendously in the upscaling
                process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are no graphics options in IX except a

                good in this PC port. They're completely unchanged from the originals and
                obviously look dated compared to today's CG animation, but they've been
                re-rendered at a far higher resolution, which I'm assuming is native 1440x1080
                (Square maintained the 4:3 aspect ratio). I ran FFIX at 2560x1440p and could
                detect a bit of artifacting and loss of detail in the FMV at that resolution,
                but at 1080p this is about as good as it could possibly get. Bless whoever at
                Square Honolulu (which created the FMV sequences around the same time it was
                making The Spirits Within) archived the assets for these
                videos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img

                scale with resolution and look crisp even at 1440p. While the textures on random
                NPCs are apparently low resolution and blurry when scaled up, the major
                characters have redrawn textures that, on the whole, look fantastic. In
                close-ups, the redrawn textures have a bit of a vectorized look to them, but the
                style fits IX's exaggerated character models well. This feels like it's about as
                good as it's going to get without a full-on remake with higher-poly models and
                far more detailed textures across the board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If only the
                pre-rendered backgrounds could have fared as well. I don't know if Square has
                forever lost the original assets for the backgrounds, or whether re-rendering
                all of them for modern resolutions was simply too difficult a task for the scope
                of this port. Whatever the reason, the backgrounds have been run through a
                filter to upscale them instead of being recreated, and the results are painful.
                High detail backgrounds suffer the most, and&amp;nbsp;all of the backgrounds are
                blurry, making the sharp 3D models stand out strongly in contrast. The two
                styles no longer gel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img

                resolution.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FMV is at its worst
                when it transitions between video sequence and pre-rendered background, because
                movement highlights the pixelization and loss of detail in these videos. The
                second screenshot above is a quick example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it's possible
                for Square to one day dig up &lt;a
                href="http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=551612"&gt;the original high
                resolution art&lt;/a&gt; and re-render these backgrounds the way Capcom did with
                Resident Evil, I hope they will. But I don't expect that to happen. For now, IX
                is best played on a smaller/lower resolution display or on a TV far away from
                your face. On my 27-inch 1440p monitor, I found playing the game from about five
                feet away helped smooth over the loss of detail of the backgrounds. Playing on a
                1080p TV would lessen the issue even more. A 1080p monitor right up in your
                face, though, is a recipe for sadness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UI overall looks
                great: clean and sharp, though I miss the personality of IX's original font. The
                worst change is the character naming screens, where the sans-serif font and
                white background look garish and unstyled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img
                data-fullimage-src="http://ec0c5a7f741a6f3bff65-dd07187202f57fa404a8f047da2bcff5.r85.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/t3blGsCwRYek.png"

                alt="Ff9 2016-04-15 15-30-24-50"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old fans may not care for
                the new battle menu, which is oversized (presumably as a result of the mobile
                port) and obscures more of the screen than the original. We'll see if modders go
                after this one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Performance&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Square Enix
                recommends a Core i5 2520 2.4GHz CPu, 4GB of RAM, and at least an Nvidia 8600
                GTS or Radeon HD 4650 graphics card to play the game. The 8600 GTS came out in
                2007, and I'm pleased to report that the FFIX runs fabulously on modern
                hardware. I played several hours of the game on my laptop with an i5-6200U CPU
                and Intel HD Graphics 520, and never saw performance dip in battle, cities or on
                the world map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Square hasn't undertaken the
                major work that would be required to make the entire game run at 60 frames per
                second or an unlocked framerate, and battles are still sluggish thanks to
                lengthy animations. A modder on &lt;a
                href="http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=201133434&amp;amp;postcount=470"&gt;Neogaf
                has also created a mod to up the battle speed's framerate to 24fps&lt;/a&gt;;
                since game logic is tied to animation speed, this will speed up how quickly
                battles play out. If you want slower battles but faster animations, set the
                in-game battle speed to its lowest setting and use this mod. There's also the
                fast forward option if you want to run everything at lightning
                speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I haven't experienced any crashes or other issues, but
                I've seen multiple reports of graphics glitches like the world map not
                appearing. This seems to be related to current Nvidia drivers, and will likely
                be fixed in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img

                15-35-11-65"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Audio&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one glaring
                issue with the FFIX port, aside from the low resolution backgrounds, is its
                audio. The music sometimes has a tinny, static-y quality that sounds inferior to
                the original version. According to another Neogaf poster, who compared the
                game's audio playback with a soundtrack version on Youtube, &lt;a
                href="http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=201127080&amp;amp;postcount=449"&gt;poor
                audio sampling is to blame here&lt;/a&gt;. The end result is music that sounds
                compressed, which is a shame&amp;mdash;FFIX has a wonderful
                soundtrack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this is improved with an official patch,
                but I wouldn't be surprised if modders get there first, and make it possible to
                play audio files from a soundtrack folder instead of the audio assets that ship
                with the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Wrapping up&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Final Fantasy
                IX isn't a perfect port, but it's far better than I expected. The audio issue
                and control bugs should be fairly low effort to patch, and the bigger problems
                like slow battle animations and low-res pre-rendered backgrounds were likely
                never going to be fixed without a complete remake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall
                state of the port makes me hopeful that a small but dedicated mod scene pops up
                around IX to fix and improve its weaknesses, then to actually mod the content of
                the game. Final Fantasy IX is one of my favorite games ever made, but I know it
                has its weaknesses. Modders, if you're reading: that Trance system sure could
                use an overhaul.&lt;/p&gt;

                alt="Dc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All my friends wanted to kill Drizzt Do’Urden
                and take his magic swords.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Baldur’s Gate was one of those
                games everyone played simultaneously, showing up to school the next day full of
                stories about what they’d discovered in their explorations of the Forgotten
                Realms. They all eventually met Drizzt, the hero of a series of Dungeons
                &amp;amp; Dragons novels popular with the kind of teenager who loves angsty
                outcast loners who stab the deserving. In Baldur’s Gate, Drizzt can be found
                near Beregost where a gang of gnolls&amp;mdash;the evil hyena-people of
                D&amp;amp;D&amp;mdash;ambush him, and he turns to you for help. He obviously
                doesn’t need that help, because he’s a recognizable named character being
                attacked by anonymous beastmen. He is in danger, however, because of the nature
                of players, who are a threat far more devious than any
                gnolls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are dozens of forum threads and YouTube
                tutorials explaining how to kill Drizzt and arguing over which is the best
                technique. Some try to get a precise distance away so that the gnolls’ AI is
                triggered and they attack Drizzt before his own AI activates and he can
                retaliate. Others surround him with their own party members, then dismiss those
                party members so they stand on the spot like statues forming a perfect cage,
                making it easy to pepper him with arrows for the hour or so it takes to chip
                away all of his hit points. Others have schemes involving invisibility,
                backstabs, summoning spells, drinking all of your potions at once, or finding a
                way to attack him from a nearby island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;img
                data-fullimage-src="http://36646d87786feafc0611-0338bbbce19fc98919c6293def4c5554.r0.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/nb0VdO9lRQew.jpg"

                alt="Baldur"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sure, they want to loot his corpse so they
                can have his fancy magic gear, and for some it’s a way of adding an additional
                tangle of challenge to a game that probably doesn’t need to be any harder, but
                it goes beyond that. Even as kids, people just want to see Drizzt dead
                [1].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In games that let us play new characters in established
                fictional settings, characters who aren’t the heroes of the original stories, we
                resent the appearance of the real stars. When they appear we feel like we’ve
                been demoted. They’re inevitably more powerful than we are, but it’s more than
                that. They feel more central to the setting. It’s hard not to feel like the
                character you’re inhabiting, whether it’s one you were handed or created
                yourself, is thin and half-finished compared to the stars of the show with years
                of continuity behind them. I am very attached to my hobbit minstrel in The Lord
                Of The Rings Online but when he bumps into Frodo and friends being pursued by
                the Black Riders he can’t help but seem inconsequential and a bit silly [2]. (It
                probably doesn’t help that I named him Spagbol Harfoot.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                &lt;img

                alt="Lotro3 weathertop"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can see why creators often
                shoehorn the original characters into games where they aren’t playable. They’re
                worried that the settings won’t be able to sell the game on their own, that fans
                will be as perplexed by their absence as they were by that Bourne movie without
                Jason Bourne in it. But fans are actually much more likely to be angered by
                these iconic characters showing up without living up to their
                potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the climax of Shadowrun Returns one of the
                Shadowrun RPG’s most recognizable characters appears, an immortal elf named
                Harlequin. Rather than saving the day on his own he asks for your help, and
                under your control in the ensuing battle feels like he’s near your own power
                level rather than being so far beyond that he can’t even be represented
                numerically as the tabletop game insisted. Fans were disappointed to be given
                control of the flash bastard only to see him miss attack rolls like some kind of
                ordinary pleb. We don’t want to our heroes to be too powerful, but we’re just as
                annoyed when they’re not badass enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The easiest solution
                is steer clear of the original fiction’s protagonists entirely, making use of
                secondary characters instead. You can have Mon Mothma deliver the mission
                briefings in a Star Wars game without anyone fussing over whether her stats are
                accurate, but more importantly secondary characters provide opportunities for
                new characters to interact with them in ways that mirror the source material.
                Shadow Of Mordor only really starts to feel like it’s a Middle-Earth game when
                you’re given the opportunity to re-enact those scenes where someone tries to get
                information out of Gollum while he wheedles and coughs. The Walking Dead lets
                you interact with familiar survivors like Hershel Greene and Glenn the pizza guy
                in ways that differ from how Rick Grimes does, which gives both the game, and
                its star Lee, an identity that’s at once familiar but
                different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;img

                alt="Dc" style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial,
                sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While meeting our heroes never works out
                well, there’s a lot more potential in meeting the villains&amp;mdash;being able
                to measure ourselves against bad guys we know and love to hate, seeing whether
                we can survive against Darth Vader or a Xenomorph. It also saves time that would
                otherwise be wasted setting up a new opponent who has to be inserted into the
                setting without seeming redundant or ineffectual. An existing villain brings all
                their threat and menace with them. All you have to do is namedrop the Joker to
                have players worried about having to face him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course,
                that can go badly too. When you face the Joker in his Amusement Mile murder
                circus in DC Universe Online you do so knowing that Batman will be fighting
                alongside you the entire time, which takes the oomph out of the moment. You’re
                given things to do like breaking the Joker’s gadgets when he uses them to set
                off toxic gas bombs or electrocute Batman, then you fight his clown goons when
                they inevitably burst out of the giant gift-boxes surrounding the fight, but
                it’s a condescending attempt at making you feel involved. You’re sitting at the
                superhero equivalent of the kiddie table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the end of the
                battle the Joker escapes because of course he does, the Bat in pursuit while you
                untie Commissioner Gordon and clean up the mess. It’s another perfect example of
                the hero showing up to overshadow our new character, making us seem
                second-class. If anyone can find a good tutorial out there explaining how to
                kill Batman and take his Batarangs, let me know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;em style="background-color: initial;"&gt;[1]&amp;nbsp;Elminster
                doesn’t fare much better. In the Forgotten Realms novels and sourcebooks he’s an
                immensely powerful wizard and all-purpose deus ex machina, and in Baldur’s Gate
                his main job is to say enigmatic things and vanish. He’s a divisive character.
                Elminster is programmed to be able to teleport away before he suffers enough
                damage to die, but people on the internet have been able to kill him as well
                because of course they have.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em
                style="background-color: initial;"&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em style="background-color:
                initial;"&gt;[2]&amp;nbsp;At another point in The Lord Of The Rings Online you
                and several other hobbits are mistaken for the more famous ones and captured.
                Aragorn arrives to free you, though only because he thinks one of the other
                prisoners (who is named Mundo, poor guy) might be Frodo. It’s bad enough when
                the real hero has to save your pudgy butt, but when he’s only doing it because
                you happen to be in a cell next to someone who resembles a character more
                important than you, it doesn’t do a lot for your self-esteem. Thanks, Aragorn.
                At least Drizzt asks you for help rescuing him rather than vice
                versa.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                has announced that it will come to an end on April 25, so that “final
                preparations” can begin for the launch next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Our
                sincerest thanks to all of our Closed Beta testers and everyone in the Overwatch
                community for participating in this critical part of the game’s development

                update video that Blizzard will now shift into a slower schedule of updates with
                fewer radical changes, focusing instead on stability, bug fixes, and
                infrastructure. Barring unforeseen disaster, the studio will be able get back to
                more interesting updates, with things like new competitive modes and spectator

                an end in all regions at around 10 am PT, and no further players will be added
                to the beta between now and then. But don't feel too badly if you didn't get in:

                who have preordered kicking off on May 3. Overwatch comes out on May
                24.&lt;/p&gt;

                alt="LoL Teemo Header"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The face of evil in League of
                Legends is none other than a cute, mischievous squirrel whose sole purpose is to
                make your life a living hell: after all, he isn’t called ‘Satan’ for
                nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Teemo has garnered a lot of hate since his original
                release in 2009, and continues to reduce grown men to salty tears of bitter
                resentment and hatred. You only have to type his name into Google to be met with
                a plethora of forum posts preaching detest towards the poison-wielding ball of
                fur. Similarly, a quick search on Youtube will summon a myriad of songs, troll
                builds and montages, as well as the usual comments wishing ill fate upon his
                creators. But why does everyone and their grandmother hate this adorable
                tyke?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Well, Teemo is one of the most frustrating champions to
                play against, especially early on in laning phase. If used properly his kit can
                create tsunamis of rage that echo throughout Summoner’s Rift. This is due to the
                global taunt that manages to annoy his opponents to the brink of insanity, and
                even his own teammates when he inadvertently steals a kill via one of his
                Noxious Traps. Oops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;His kit&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; Teemo’s main
                source of damage comes from his passive ability Toxic Shot, which adds bonus
                magic damage and poison to his basic attacks. To make things worse each auto
                attack refreshes the duration of the poison, which can become nightmarish with
                the correct build.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Good Teemo players will utilise Toxic Shot
                by safely last hitting minions from a safe distance, while constantly punishing
                their opponents every move, denying farm and the precious gold they need to help
                nullify the potency of his attacks. If out of pure frustration his opponent
                decides to challenge Teemo he can just use Blinding Dart to stop incoming auto
                attacks for a maximum of 2.5 seconds, giving him a brief window to deal some
                extra damage, often winning the trade. Teemo can also use his Move Quick
                ability, doubling his bonus movement speed for 3 seconds, allowing him to either
                escape incoming danger or give chase to a low health enemy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                &lt;img class="gfyitem" alt="AcrobaticCoordinatedBeardeddragon (gfyCat video) "
                data-id="AcrobaticCoordinatedBeardeddragon" data-controls="false"
                data-title="false" data-autoplay="true"
                data-expand="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If our fiendish fur ball is aware of
                an incoming gank from the enemy jungler, or simply wants to unleash a
                devastating surprise attack, he can simply stand still or enter a brush while
                taking no damage for 1.5 seconds. This grants him the use of his stealth
                ability, Camouflage. When his stealth is broken, Teemo is granted additional
                attack speed for a maximum of three seconds. With the correct positioning this
                ability can allow for a great deal of harass early on, and even net his team a
                quick and easy First Blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To make matters worse, his
                ultimate allows him to plant and throw poisonous mushrooms all over Summoner’s
                Rift. These noxious traps can be strategically placed in areas of high enemy
                movement, providing deadly ward coverage with a twist. If an enemy steps on a
                mushroom, it will detonate and poison all nearby enemies, slowing them while
                dealing magic damage for four seconds. These life-taking mushrooms have six
                health and can only be damaged by basic attacks, and only when visible from
                using either Pink Wards or the Sweeping Lens Trinket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;img
                class="gfyitem" alt="DemandingGlitteringBorzoi (gfyCat video) "
                data-id="DemandingGlitteringBorzoi" data-controls="false" data-title="false"
                data-autoplay="true" data-expand="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By simply placing
                these mushrooms Teemo can defend breaches on key objectives, set up elaborate
                traps, control the enemy jungle, and secure safe passage to the game-changing
                Baron Nashor and Dragon camps. The above will reward him and his team with some
                very easy kills as his opponents trudge their way through toxic trap after toxic
                trap, until their lifeless bodies fall in a painful heap on the ground. “That’s
                gotta sting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the panic and disarray sets in, Teemo has
                already split pushed top lane and is destroying the base you fought so hard to
                defend. Just as he’s about to deliver the last blow to your nexus he spams a
                taunt that fills your eardrums with the most annoyingly cute laugh followed by
                the inevitable “gg ez”. It’s at this point that your blood curdles, your tired
                weary hands form fists, and you yell expletives at the top of your lungs,
                filling the the room with your bitter anguish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Teemo has
                successfully converted another player into nothing more than a blubbering primal
                ape whose shouting has woken up the entire street. Your sleep deprived flatmate
                walks in and is about to give you a lecture until they see you’re an
                uncontrollable sobbing mess, they look at the screen, they see Teemo’s wry grin,
                and lay a sympathetic hand upon your shoulder. Life sure can be miserable
                playing against this devilish Yordle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The
                defense&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; This frustration is often due to many players
                believing that Teemo takes no skill, mixed with the feeling that there is little
                to no counter play. Everyone who plays League of Legends has a champion they
                hate to lane against, whether it’s because they feel they can’t do anything
                against them or just don’t fully understand how to counter them. We have all
                been in unpleasant situations where the laning phase feels like a lost cause.
                For many people, Teemo is the embodiment of those feelings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                &lt;img
                data-fullimage-src="http://0cb8dd5d2dc142d08f0f-eb3b436d25971e5860b39e72b0600342.r94.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/wfIZWbU5TSau.jpg"

                alt="LoL Jax"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Teemo used to be a viable pick in season
                one where he would wreak havoc on popular picks like Jax and other melee
                champions who relied on auto attacks to deliver the majority of their damage. He
                could just use his blinding dart to disable their auto attack damage for a few
                seconds, creating a window of opportunity to kill his opponent without taking
                any damage himself. A lot of early champions simply didn’t have the movement and
                gap-closers that we see in League of Legends’ current meta-game. This gave Teemo
                free reign to outmanoeuvre his opponents, easily kiting champions like Singed or
                Cho’Gath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Teemo is no longer the satanic monster he used to
                be, however. He’s annoying and can be very hard for new players to understand,
                but with a cool head and a little experience he really isn’t that bad by today’s
                standards. Firstly, Teemo is a bit of an anomaly as he doesn’t fit into any team
                very well. He doesn’t fit the role of a tank/bruiser which is usually associated
                with top lane champions, nor does he have the burst to fare well in mid lane
                which is filled with mid lane assassins whose gap closers and burst kill the
                little guy within a few seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;img class="gfyitem"
                alt="JadedSomberAfricanrockpython (gfyCat video) "
                data-id="JadedSomberAfricanrockpython" data-controls="false" data-title="false"
                data-autoplay="true" data-expand="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His ability to
                jungle is laughable, being widely considered as “troll pick” by the community,
                and the most he can do down bottom lane is ward with his mushshrooms and use his
                blinding dart to disable the AD carry’s auto attacks. While this seems
                advantageous, Teemo can accidentally snag the kill for himself with his poison
                damage, denying his ADC of a kill that he/she needs to become a greater presence
                in the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Our rodent friend sure gets a lot of stick
                considering his short attack range, minimal health, inability to carry well when
                fed, and lacklustre team fighting abilities&amp;mdash;he is anything but
                “Satanic”. If anything the majority of Teemo players end up being forced into
                teamfights or left cowering under their turret, which makes him simply useless.
                He can’t go and help his team by split pushing lanes, creating vital map
                pressure, nor can he provide coverage with his mushshrooms that allow control
                over key buffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sadly the little Yordle just doesn’t appear
                to have the impact he did back in previous seasons, and he has been pushed aside
                in favour of champions like Fiora with her huge snowball and carry potential and
                champions like Malphite who offers greater utility in terms of an ultimate that
                can turnaround teamfights with relatively low risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But
                regardless of his abundant weaknesses, Teemo remains to many players a
                frustrating, unfair, champion. But does our poor little furry friend deserve all
                this hate? Originally, the answer would most definitely be yes: even I as a
                Teemo main would have held my guilty hands up. But as League of Legends
                continues to evolve with every new patch, and more and more champions continue
                to fill the ever growing roster, Teemo has become less of the terrifying monster
                he once was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;img class="pulled-image pull-left"

            <category>Street Fighter V</category>
            <content:encoded>

                &lt;p&gt;Capcom has &lt;a
                href="http://www.capcom-unity.com/harrisony/blog/2016/04/18/guile-joins-street-fighter-v-and-april-update-news"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt;
                that Guile, he of the grim visage and car buffer coiffure, will leap into the
                &lt;a href="http://www.pcgamer.com/street-fighter-v/"&gt;Street Fighter V
                fray&lt;/a&gt; later this month. He'll come&amp;nbsp;with his own Character
                Story and set of Trials, as well as an expanded repertoire of moves including a
                new ability called Faultless Move that enables him to advance in a “crouch walk
                state” while keeping his charge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arrival of Guile will
                also see the release of the first Street Fighter V DLC stage, which will very
                appropriately be Guile's Air Force Base. Owners of the season pass will be given
                the level at no charge, while everyone else will have the option of purchasing
                it for 70,000 FM [Fight Money]. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new “Rage Quit System” is
                also on the way, which will lock players “who have high disconnect rates during
                matches” out of matchmaking for a set period of time, although whether that will
                replace or reinforce the LP and rank drop penalties that were &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/street-fighter-v-rage-quitters-punished-with-lp-and-rank-drops/"&gt;rolled
                out in March&lt;/a&gt; wasn't said. Improvements to the matchmaking system are
                coming as well that are meant to improve the process of creating and connecting
                to Battle Lounges, and should also make it easier to find opponents.
                &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guile will be free for all players until the real-money &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/street-fighter-v-doing-dlc-differently-unlock-it-by-playing-the-game/"&gt;Zenny&lt;/a&gt;
                shop goes live, after which he'll be available for purchase for 100,000 FM or
                600 Zenny, which works out to $6. A specific release date hasn't been
                announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks, &lt;a

                alt="This week’s PC gaming deals"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We like cheap PC
                components and accessories. But you know what we like even more? Expensive PC
                components and accessories that are on sale! Each week, we have
                our&amp;nbsp;bargainmeisters bring you a list of the best component, accessory,
                and software sales for PC gamers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Some
                highlights of this week: &lt;/strong&gt;Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor's Game of
                the Year Edition is massively on sale, along with The Banner Saga. There are
                some great GPU deals to be found as well, including options on the low and high
                ends of the spectrum. A GTX 960 and a GTX 980 Ti are both on sale and both come
                with a game free. There's also a Corsair case with great airflow on sale over at
                Amazon, and that manufacturer refurbished Logitech mouse is still a very good
                deal to grab if you are looking for a new mouse.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

                alt="Legion Box Cover WoW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blizzard has announced that
                &lt;a href="http://www.pcgamer.com/world-of-warcraft-legion/"&gt;World of
                Warcraft: Legion&lt;/a&gt; will be out on August 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sixth
                &lt;a href="http://www.pcgamer.com/world-of-warcraft/"&gt;World of
                Warcraft&lt;/a&gt; expansion will follow the events that unfolded in &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/world-of-warcraft-warlords-of-draenor/"&gt;Warlords
                of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, as the betrayer Gul'dan unleashes a demonic invasion
                “unlike any the Horde and the Alliance have ever faced,” &lt;a
                href="http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/blog/20101160/the-legion-returns-august-30-18-04-2016"&gt;Blizzard
                said&lt;/a&gt;. Players will travel to the new continent known as the Broken
                Isles, wield new Artifacts, and forge alliances with the Demon Hunters of the
                Illidari, the “vengeful disciples of the dreaded Illidan
                Stormrage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More practically, pre-purchasing World of
                Warcraft: Legion will grant players an immediate boost to level 100 for any one
                of their characters, so they can leap into the Broken Isles action as soon as
                the expansion goes live. Pre-purchasing will also unlock access to the new Demon
                Hunter hero class ahead of Legion's launch, our&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/hands-on-with-wow-legions-demon-hunter-class/"&gt;impressions&lt;/a&gt;
                of which&amp;nbsp;we wrote about last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully the
                rollout of Legion will go more smoothly than that of its predecessor, Warlords
                of Draenor: The new content was &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/world-of-warcraft-warlords-of-draenor-review-in-progress/"&gt;pleasing&lt;/a&gt;,
                but Executive Producer J. Allan Brack &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/blizzard-apologizes-for-warlords-of-draenor-launch-adds-free-time-for-subscribers/"&gt;issued
                an apology&lt;/a&gt; in November 2014 for what he acknowledged was a "sub-par
                launch experience." Full details on the World of Warcraft: Legion expansion are
                up at &lt;a

                data-fullimage-src="http://e5c351ecddc2f880ef72-57d6ff1fc59ab172ec418789d348b0c1.r69.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/0CAZRRhYRki7.jpg"

                alt="Hpz1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The all-in-one category is still dominated by
                systems designed for general purpose computing chores, though little by little,
                the landscape is changing. We've seen some AIOs emerge with gaming chops, too.
                On the development side of the equation, HP today announced its third generation
                Z1 G3 workstation, a powerful AIO with some interesting
                amenities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HP says the Z1 G3 is "built for demanding users,"
                though also for those who want to make the most out of their physical work
                space. Boasting a 23.6-inch 4K Ultra HD display, the new Z1 G3 is 47 percent
                smaller and 51 percent lighter than the previous generation. It's also lighter
                on the wallet with a starting price ($1,498) that's 21 percent less expensive
                than before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We took our groundbreaking, and most innovative
                workstation- the original Z1-and reinvented it by listening to our customers to
                create a new smaller, lighter and lower cost model," said Jeff Wood, vice
                president and general manager, Workstations and Thin Clients, HP
                Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though it's smaller and lighter, it's no less capable.
                The third-generation Z1 G3 packs new processor options based on Intel's Skylake
                architecture that run the gamut from a Core i3-6100 on up to a Xeon E3-1270
                v5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also configure the Z1 G3 with up to 64GB of
                DDR4-2133 RAM (ECC or non-ECC), up to two PCIe HP Z Turbo Drives and two
                additional 2.5-inch drives, and up to an Nvidia Quadro M2000M graphics card with
                4GB of GDDR5 memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="" style="display: block;
                margin: auto;"
                data-fullimage-src="http://4d663a369f9f03c3c61e-870e77779efd63f7bd6c2ee08d8cfae6.r2.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/IXqq1pqRTcuX.jpg"

                alt="HP Z1 G3 Open"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those are some server-grade hardware
                options in an AIO form factor. It's also easy to service and upgrade or replace
                parts. That's because the Z1 G3 sports a "completely serviceable chassis" with a
                back panel that pops off without any tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HP says the Z1 G3
                will be available to configure and purchase next month.&lt;/p&gt;

                href="http://www.shacknews.com/article/94156/what-is-hoxar-inc-apparently-john-romero-knows"
                target="_blank"&gt;Shacknews&lt;/a&gt; posted an interesting story on Friday
                about Hoxar Inc, which on the surface appears to be a tech start-up promoting a
                new technology called Blackroom, a holodeck-like “fully immersive experience
                without physical restriction,” including the need for goggles. “Hoxar has spent
                years innovating and pushing the boundaries of holographic technology beyond its
                competitors,” its &lt;a href="http://www.hoxar-inc.com/"
                target="_blank"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; says. “Now, with the latest Hoxar DPHM
                Simulators, users can experience a walkable space that feels, smells, and looks
                like the real thing&amp;mdash;or unreal thing, as is usually
                preferred.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is relevant to our interests because,
                according to the report, a “credible anonymous source” told the site that Hoxar
                is actually related to a new game being developed by &lt;a
                href="http://www.romerogames.ie/" target="_blank"&gt;Romero Games&lt;/a&gt;, the
                studio co-founded by Doom and Quake co-creator John Romero. How exactly they're
                tied together isn't made clear&amp;mdash;anonymous sources often tend not to
                want to connect too many dots&amp;mdash;and the website registration information
                is private, revealing only that it was registered out of Scottsdale, AZ, also
                the location of Hoxar HQ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not much to go on, but there
                is one little spot of information that gives it the unmistakable sheen of
                legitimacy: “Yes, there may be something to this,” Romero himself &lt;a
                href="https://twitter.com/romero/status/721093845161783297"
                target="_blank"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;, adding the #pc and #fps
                hashtags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt; &lt;p
                dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;Yes, there may be something to this. &lt;a

                target="_blank"&gt;https://t.co/vHJgMPOPff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash;
                John Romero (@romero) &lt;a
                href="https://twitter.com/romero/status/721093845161783297"
                target="_blank"&gt;April 15,
                2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; He hasn't said anything
                about it since, and there's nothing on the Hoxar website or &lt;a
                href="https://www.facebook.com/HOXAR-Inc-496713153850709/?fref=ts"
                target="_blank"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; that leap out as obviously
                game-releated, although everything it promises is all very future-tech, and just
                a little too post-VR to be the real deal.
                Probably.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Blackroom truly springs to life
                thanks to Hoxar's unique Predictive Memory Technology (PMT), which analyses the
                user’s memory and constructs a simulation that is incredibly lifelike,
                non-predictable and responsive,” it says. “Virtual reality is but a thing of the
                past, thanks to Blackroom and PMT; this is a new digital reality, available soon
                from Hoxar, Inc.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's also an emphasis on
                Blackroom's potential military applications that has all the hallmarks of
                &lt;em&gt;ominous foreshadowing&lt;/em&gt;. Clearly something is cooking here:
                I've emailed Romero Games and Hoxar to ask what's going on, and I'll let you
                know if I get anything back.&lt;/p&gt;

                being a video game protagonist. Maybe you’ll run the rooftops of a pristine

                you’ll fight long into the abyss. And maybe the abyss also fights into you.

                shooting and sneaking is predetermined, so expect to die to deathclaws a lot.
                The feel of incomprehensible complexity is still there though: some players
                report having killed as few as two people on their way through the story. You'll
                need sound and annotations enabled to have your own crack at it.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt; The idea is so simple that an eight year old could conjure it up. In
                fact it’s probably one that most eight-year-olds since 1977 have at one point or
                another fantasised about. Pop an Oculus Rift on your head, boot up Eve: Valkyrie
                and suddenly you’re inside the cockpit of a careening, laser-loaded, missile
                firing, dip-dodge and diving, space-bound dog-fighter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div
                class="fancy-box"&gt; &lt;h5 class="title"&gt;NEED TO KNOW&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;p&gt;
                &lt;strong&gt;What is it&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Oculus Rift launch game set in
                the Eve universe, letting you take control of a dog-fighting space
                ship.&lt;br&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Publisher&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;CCP
                Games&lt;br&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Developer&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;CCP

                &lt;strong&gt;Link&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
                href="http://www.evevalkyrie.com"&gt;Official site&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’s proper gasp-out-loud stuff, seeing enemy
                ships zoom past and being able to follow them with real life head turns as they
                go. The most immediately arresting, and perhaps surprising thing about all this,
                especially considering its foundation in the famously complex Eve Online
                universe, is just how intuitive it all is. Holding a gamepad in your hand and
                using the sticks to control the pitch and yaw of your vessel is a breeze, while
                your weapon systems are tied to the two triggers. Lasers fire straight forward,
                requiring active tailing of foes and proper positional awareness in order to
                fire just ahead of them in time-honoured flight-fighting fashion. Missiles
                meanwhile are where all that VR innovation suddenly becomes a much more active
                ingredient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pressing left trigger then eyeballing foes and
                following their trajectory up, down, and all around allows time for your
                missiles to achieve lock-on. The longer you’re able to keep a bad ‘un in view,
                the more of your missiles you can unload on them at once. Get yourself in a
                prime position, free of nearby debris and with an open view of your quarry. Hear
                the beeping indicator alerting you of a lock-on, and then release your left
                trigger to let loose the payload. It’s intensely satisfying stuff, and the sort
                of videogame joy that’s immediate and clear. The thrill of having the Kill
                indicator popping up in front of your face as you wheel away from a hard-earned
                barrage of death ‘splosions to your rear is something everyone can appreciate. I
                even tested it on some non-gaming relatives&amp;mdash;it’s easier to show people
                what the Rift is than to explain why there is now a mountain of cables and
                hardware taking over your living room&amp;mdash;and it had them gasping, cooing
                and ahhing. I couldn’t get my Dad into bowling on the Wii yet here he was
                happily downing spaceships in an Eve game. In VR. Who knew?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                Valkyrie, by its nature, is an arcade experience. Those of us weaned on the
                likes of Elite: Dangerous or prior to that, Freespace, will find their cockpit
                stripped back and built for shorter, shallower, yet more bombastic combat
                experiences. Having sunk hundreds of hours into both of those aforementioned
                games, I invariably found myself looking around my Valkyrie cockpit and wishing
                I could interact with the myriad levers, buttons and flashing doo-dads that fill
                the space. I couldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet for all the essentially useless
                tat on display there’s a respectable efficiency to certain individual elements
                of the cockpit’s design. Shield and hull armour meters hang in front of you to
                either side, and as you go about the task of not blowing up you find yourself
                actively looking around whenever a red emergency light’s glow extends into your
                missile firing vision. Which, again, feels cool, giving your gaze yet more
                agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the world outside of your cockpit
                there are further appreciable design tweaks to enable or reinforce your probably
                soon-to-be aching neck’s influence on proceedings. Enemy ships leave a very
                clear red tail behind them, much more so than would normally be found in your
                typical dog-fighter, just to make it that little bit easier to crane your view
                in their direction. Hull integrity can be boosted by picking up floating armour
                packs&amp;mdash;I did say it was an arcade experience&amp;mdash;which glow tell
                tale green against the backdrop of explosions and general space chaos ensuing
                around them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But for all the depth in design Valkyrie remains
                a fairly shallow experience. There’s a levelling up and ship upgrade system,
                which through play allows you to tinker with your load outs. It’s a lamentably
                slow process. It might take hours to even gain access to your first upgrade, and
                this is only an incremental stat boost which I could hardly even notice the
                effects of once equipped. It takes even longer to earn yourself a new ship, and
                unfortunately, by that point you’ll have repeated the same stages, and the same
                actions, tens of times over and it’s easy to feel like you’ve seen all that
                Valkyrie has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Partly this is down to the game’s
                heavy multiplayer reliance. After an initial opening mission which sets up the
                tone of the story, Valkyrie splits into two game modes. There’s Chronicles,
                which can be played in single player, and Combat, which is where you go for up
                to 8v8 PVP kicks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img

                alt="Eve 3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronicles shoots you out into one of the
                game’s maps, to either explore them all comfortable like, sans enemies,
                collecting salvage and listening to audio logs, or to tackle waves of AI
                controlled bots in a Survival mode. There’s a story here, but it’s told in a
                disappointingly disengaged way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are in control of a clone
                of a dead pilot (and that’s not a spoiler, you start the game dead), and these
                levels have, according to the whisperings of Katee Sackhoff (Battlestar
                Galactica’s Starbuck) been reconstructed from the databanks and memories of
                other pilots who have died there. All that we’re seeing play out across these
                stages happened long in the past. It’s all already over. I know the whole clone
                thing is supposed to explain why we’re allowed to die repeatedly again and
                again, but there’s no escaping that the&amp;nbsp;framing device burdens the
                whole affair with a veneer of futility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Over in multiplayer
                you play through those same maps endlessly, as part of an eight strong team.
                With no narrative to hold things back, and with combat boiling down to spectacle
                over legitimate tactical warfare, things get old fast.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div
                class="fancy-box"&gt; &lt;h5 class="title"&gt;PERFORMANCE&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;p&gt;
                Loading times exist, though are not deal-breakingly long. The main menu UI is
                woeful, however, with the recognition of which element of the HUD you’re looking
                at patchy at best. It occasionally takes multiple tries to select things. I
                found that a lot of online matches were populated by bots, even after launch,
                implying that servers might be a little underpopulated. &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; Every lump of praise and nugget of criticism I’ve fired at
                Eve: Valkyrie might all be completely irrelevant for a certain group of players,
                however. The Oculus Rift store rates Valkyrie’s comfort level as ‘Intense’ for a
                very good reason. Despite CCP working some design magic to limit nausea as you
                barrel roll through space&amp;mdash;ensuring no maps have a natural horizon line
                for your inner ear to throw a wobbly at, for example&amp;mdash;there’s no
                escaping the game’s ability to cause tummy upsets for some. Me
                included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While playing, I had to rip the Rift off every 20
                or so minutes in order to let my stomach calm down. I’ve never suffered from
                motion sickness before, but found myself susceptible to it here. There’s an
                element of physical endurance to the whole affair of playing Valkyrie, from that
                nausea, to the slowly heating up tech that’s wrapped around your face. It’s just
                not built for sustained play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So while Eve: Valkyrie attempts
                to herald in a new era of VR gaming, deep down it feels very much like a
                behemoth of yesteryear. It would fit in perfectly in an arcade on your local
                pier, between the Time Crisis 2 machine that refuses to die and a Star Wars
                Battlepod. It’s an incredible experience, and one which in 20 minutes will
                convince you of VR’s gaming future. But beyond that initial foray you’ll have
                too many excuses to disembark. And that’s if you don’t throw up in your
                mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt;Because of difficulties capturing shots of
                EVE: Valkyrie in VR, we have used press shots for this
                review.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Insomniac is going all-in on VR. In partnership with Oculus Studios,
                it's releasing two more Rift games this year in addition to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a

                allowfullscreen=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Unspoken, targeted for the end
                of the year, plans to capitalise on the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/oculus-talks-about-hard-decision-to-ship-touch-controller-after-rift-headset/"
                target="_blank"&gt;Oculus Touch controllers&lt;/a&gt; which ought to be out by
                then. Two battle wizards, each controlled by a player, duel it out in modern-day
                Chicago, waving arms in mystical sweeps to cast spells. Get good enough and
                you'll be able to read your opponent's hand gestures and counter on the
                fly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315"

                allowfullscreen=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trailer for Feral Rites,
                coming Autumn, doesn't give much away. In brief, it's a third person,
                quest-driven, combo-based&amp;nbsp;brawler. In conjunction with The Unspoken, it
                suggests Insomniac has found an ideal companion for VR in fighting
                games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm somewhat surprised Insomniac has chosen to make
                both games&amp;nbsp;&lt;a

                target="_blank"&gt;exclusive to the&amp;nbsp;Oculus store&lt;/a&gt;,
                particularly as&amp;nbsp;&lt;a

                target="_blank"&gt;one clever hack&lt;/a&gt; has already demonstrated how
                artificial the separation between Rift and Vive games is&amp;mdash;everything
                runs through PC, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

                its tasty loot. Beaten&amp;nbsp;this way, the weekly Incursion isn't registering
                completion, allowing the unscrupulous to farm high end gear at an obscene
                rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PvP in the Dark Zone has been thrown way out of whack as
                honest players struggle to compete with those geared to the hilt. It doesn't
                appear that there's an easy fix either&amp;mdash;this isn't a single exploit but
                a whole range of wall hacks that leverage the portable shield. The same method

                target="_blank"&gt;Free Games of the Week&lt;/a&gt;, is at work on&amp;nbsp;an
                ambitious (and commercial) new project. Southern Monsters will take you down to
                south Arkansas, where loneliness and PTSD are your companions. Your outlet
                is&amp;nbsp;a forum for monster hunters on the trail of Sasquatch and the like,
                and rumour has it there's a new beast at large not far from your house. You've
                named it Cripplefoot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Bravemule's other
                games,&amp;nbsp;Southern Monsters is an&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-free-games-of-the-week-61/"
                target="_blank"&gt;illustrated narrative adventure&lt;/a&gt;, but larger than
                ever before. With five days of game time allotted to you, the core game is split
                between managing your PTSD during the day so you're able to go in search of
                Cripplefoot at night. It promises to roll in all of writer Kevin Snow's
                frustrations at being disabled in the southern USA, laced with black
                humour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's likely to be a Kickstarter campaign down the
                line, but right now Bravemule is hoping to release Southern Monsters before the
                year is through. Here's the whole poster on account of it being

                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/rocket-league/"&gt;Rocket League&lt;/a&gt; will
                carry out a number of pedantic – but consequential – fixes to the game's ball
                and vehicle hitboxes. Due to roll out this week,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
                href="http://www.rocketleaguegame.com/news/2016/04/patch-notes-v1-16-pcps4-3/"&gt;v1.16&lt;/a&gt;
                won't introduce any noticeable changes to more casual players, but it will make
                the game more fair for the competitive scene. A number of vehicles will be
                affected, as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Fixed Scarab and Grog’s
                hitboxes, which were not long enough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fixed Breakout and
                Hotshot’s hitboxes, which were not wide enough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fixed
                Batmobile and Breakout’s hitboxes, which were abnormally
                long&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fixed Gizmo, Octane, Ripper, and Scarab’s hitboxes,
                which were too tall&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fixed Dominus’ hitbox, which was not
                long or tall enough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the ball will
                behave more realistically in the Wasteland arena, thanks to some collision
                improvements to the map itself.&amp;nbsp;A bug that allowed Battle-Cars to reach
                extraordinary heights has also been squashed, which... sounds unfortunate,
                really.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patch arrives ahead of the
                basketball-themed&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/rocket-leagues-basketball-themed-dunk-house-mode-is-coming-in-april/"&gt;Dunk
                House mode&lt;/a&gt;, which comes bearing its own mode and map based around –
                you guessed it – basketball.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The absence of a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a

                Redemption&lt;/a&gt; PC port remains one of gaming's greatest injustices, but
                will its inevitable sequel arrive on our platform? The answer, I'm afraid, is
                yet to be answered, but GTA 5's belated port gives us hope that it will. With
                those caveats in mind, cast your eyes over this reportedly leaked map from the
                sequel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img

                has claimed that a "source close to the development of the new Red Dead game"
                has confirmed that the map is legitimate. The report also claims that the game
                will in fact be a prequel to Red Dead Redemption, and takes place "just east" of
                the one we roamed in the previous game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's very much an
                unconfirmed rumour at this point, and besides: Rockstar might have decided – for
                some baffling reason – that the Red Dead series is a PC no-go zone. There are
                also rumours that Red Dead Redemption 2 will be announced at E3, but given
                Rockstar's habit of not turning up to the convention, that's probably another
                rumour to remain sceptical about.&lt;/p&gt;

                coloured space marines this weekend, then here's welcome news:
                the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.pcgamer.com/doom/"&gt;Doom&lt;/a&gt; open
                beta has been extended by a day. The announcement comes via Bethesda's
                official&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
                href="https://twitter.com/DOOM/status/721729758510190594"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;
                account, which specified that the beta will now close at&amp;nbsp;11:59pm ET. on
                April 18. That's about 9am EST in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've played only
                a tiny bit of the beta and thought it was decent, though I was disappointed that
                I couldn't run at the same speed as my rockets. The game is raising
                ire&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/350470/"&gt;among
                Steam users&lt;/a&gt;, with most objecting to the loadout and progression
                systems, as well as the perks. The gist of it is: it's not enough like the Doom
                of old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, now's a better time than ever to make that
                decision for yourself. Evan wrote about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/doom-guns-judged"&gt;the game's
                guns&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;a couple of weeks ago, and here's a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a

                allowfullscreen=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt; Late last year a speedrunner
                managed to complete&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/fallout-new-vegas"&gt;Fallout: New Vegas&lt;/a&gt;
                in an impressive&amp;nbsp;&lt;a

                minutes and 47 seconds&lt;/a&gt;. Now, barely four months later, the same
                speedrunner has managed to shave nearly a minute off that time, coming in at 19
                minutes and 48&amp;nbsp;seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's the work
                of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/kungkobra"&gt;KungKobra&lt;/a&gt;,
                and it's only the most recent record he's set&amp;nbsp;since last time we
                checked in. Since December he's been breaking his own record&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCasNybO4qSSNz5u3nFvG6jg"&gt;fairly
                regularly,&lt;/a&gt; and he reckons there's still room to improve the Any%
                run.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you're baffled by the techniques employed
                above (and you probably will be unless you're a New Vegas speedrunner),
                KungKobra's documentation is&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
                href="http://pastebin.com/ze6PQmMu"&gt;worth a read&lt;/a&gt;. All that
                quicksaving and quickloading is tricking the game into ignoring fall damage and
                skipping NPC dialogue (among other things), while his fast movement speed is
                actually a trick tied to leg damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I glitched my movement
                speed by loading a save at the exact moment my legs got crippled," KungKobra
                explains.&amp;nbsp;"This causes the game to add the slow crippled speed (roughly
                52%) on top of the regular (100%) speed, allowing me to walk at an accelerated
                pace. This trick is difficult and inconsistent, so I will most likely restart my
                runs trying to get the glitch."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a

                recently wrote about an XCOM 2 mod that promotes relationship building&lt;/a&gt;
                for your squad&amp;nbsp;members. The same modder has expanded on that premise by
                allowing your soldiers to hook up with each other&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;make
                babies. And, thanks to a time machine, the kids can then join your squad as
                fully grown&amp;nbsp;adults. Why the hell&amp;nbsp;not? Stranger things have
                happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Holds the City Overhaul, for

                years in the making, focuses on Skyrim's cities, expanding and sometimes even
                rebuilding them from the ground up to make them bigger and more densely
                populated. There are more settlements and forts, a bunch of new named NPCs with
                their own stories and schedules, and even new books that expand on the lore and
                history of Skyrim. The video above shows some of the

                alt="Black Death 2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps the greatest foe across all
                human history gets a pretty raw deal in strategy games. I’m not talking about
                Napoleon or Attila, a toxic political ideology, or jeggings. I’m talking about
                the microscopic brigands who hitch rides in our otherwise healthy bodies, spread
                from person to person, and have a tendency to kill the crap out of us: the Black
                Death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Historians love to argue, but it’s uncontroversial to
                say that this disease has had massive, ongoing, far-reaching effects for
                mankind. The Black Death swept through Europe in the 1300s &lt;a
                href="https://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/black_plague.html"&gt;killed at least 50
                million people worldwide&amp;mdash;and that’s the low estimate&lt;/a&gt;. We’re
                talking about somewhere around a third of the overall population on the
                continent, and possibly as many as half in urban centers like
                Paris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If a similar proportion of people died in the United
                States today, the body count would pass the 100 million mark. Imagine half the
                people in New York City, LA, or the San Francisco Bay Area keeling over in the
                space of less than a decade. It would change the world forever. And the Black
                Death did. Hysteria ensued. Economies were transformed. Areas under human
                cultivation for centuries were &lt;a
                href="http://spartacus-educational.com/YALDstatute.htm"&gt;reclaimed by nature
                with no one to till the fields&lt;/a&gt;, and the workers remaining found
                themselves in excellent bargaining positions with their once-untouchable feudal
                overlords due to a dire labor shortage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; In reality,
                disease has killed more soldiers in many historical wars than other soldiers.
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Considering how huge a deal the plague was
                socially, economically, and even religiously, you’d think a pop-up heralding the
                Black Death in Crusader Kings II would induce total panic. It doesn’t. Those
                jerk-ass Khazars launching minor raids into my frontier regions are a much
                greater concern. The plague is a blip on the economic radar, reducing tax income
                by 80% in affected regions (which is a lot, but does not present a long-term
                problem considering CK2 handles debt in a much more forgiving way than, for
                example, Europa Universalis IV) and causing the troops stationed there to take
                moderate casualties. A handful of named characters at my court might keel over.
                If I’m really unlucky, someone who matters might be among them. After it’s
                passed, the world remains almost indistinguishable from when it came, as if an
                uncomfortable El Niño had passed over it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Medieval 2: Total
                War models the plague similarly, with punishing but transient economic
                penalties. The infection rate for named characters is higher, but keeping them
                away from city centers is a fairly effective vaccination. Wars in both these
                games can be influenced by armies taking attrition from the outbreak and
                changing the balance of power, but it’s a rare edge case that it actually
                decides the outcome. In reality, disease has killed more soldiers in many
                historical wars than other soldiers&amp;mdash; &lt;a
                href="http://www.civilwar.org/education/pdfs/civil-was-curriculum-medicine.pdf"&gt;two
                thirds of the casualties in the Civil War were from disease&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a
                href="http://www.worldlibrary.org/articles/napoleonic_wars_casualties"&gt;Napoleon’s
                French army lost over twice as many men to disease as to combat&lt;/a&gt;, to
                name a couple. Pox and plague ambushing the camps have swung many conflicts
                wildly in one direction or another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;img
                data-fullimage-src="http://36646d87786feafc0611-0338bbbce19fc98919c6293def4c5554.r0.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/2QTC3fHORjiB.png"

                alt="Black Death 1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Down with the
                sickness&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt; The reasons for downplaying pandemics in games are
                understandable. Who wants to play a strategy game where your troops or populace
                suddenly and arbitrarily die? As Sid Meier says, a strategy game is a series of
                interesting choices. Realism doesn’t universally translate to fun, and the
                reality of diseases like the Black Death is that there was no decision anyone at
                the time could have made to significantly dampen the chaos. Without inserting
                absurdly premature discoveries about germ theory and epidemiology, our hapless,
                digital kingdoms can’t click a button or tweak a slider to make the plague
                meaningfully less terrible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Developers have used this
                argument to justify their tendency to overlook the historical impact of disease.
                Player agency is important, and not a lot of people like being told that a third
                of their populace is being carted through the streets to a pyre, including the
                king, and, by the way, your elite armies are evaporating from your battlements.
                I disagree with this methodology. It assumes that the goal of any historical
                strategy game is accumulation, or empowering players to methodically build the
                biggest and most successful empire of all time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When I think
                about what draws me to a game like Crusader Kings II or Civilization V, it isn’t
                always the process toward some arbitrary victory. Many of my most memorable runs
                have gone down in flames, ending with a family tree full of cadavers cooling in
                the grave while bandits have their merry way with what used to be my
                countryside&amp;mdash;not with spreading my color across every inch of habitable
                ground in my empire’s path. The amazing stories being co-written by the game
                engine and my own imagination (see the &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/crusader-kings-chronicle/"&gt;Crusader Kings
                Chronicles&lt;/a&gt;) are the true reward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;There are
                so many awesome possible tales that could come from a Black Death modeled with
                more unabated, historical brutality.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are so
                many awesome possible tales that could come from a Black Death modeled with more
                unabated, historical brutality. Upending social structures, starting the embers
                of religious schism, and redefining the entire economy of the world you’re
                playing in could force powerful states to cling to a crumbling status quo,
                similar to the plight of the collapsing Western Roman Empire in Total War:
                Attila’s fantastic grand campaign. The aftermath could be presented as almost
                post-apocalyptic. It’s a new setting generated by events beyond your control,
                and you’re now challenged to adapt or die. And that’s all without even
                mentioning the fun of watching the world burn. Who doesn’t love catalyzing
                humanity’s final days in &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/plague-inc-evolved-gets-head-to-head-multiplayer-next-week/"&gt;Plague
                Inc.&lt;/a&gt; or unleashing large-scale disaster on a sprawling, gleaming
                SimCity?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img
                data-fullimage-src="http://e5c351ecddc2f880ef72-57d6ff1fc59ab172ec418789d348b0c1.r69.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/-Cg3gtTYTPGC.jpg"

                alt="Plague Doctor"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Real history is dramatic. As humans,
                we understand drama as an arc with ups and downs. Moments of triumph dance with
                periods of despair. Victory means more when it emerges from bleak adversity, and
                not every great story has a happy ending. Videogames have a huge, untapped
                opportunity to take a page from their tabletop cousins like the FATE roleplaying
                game, emphasizing that the players are acting in service of an interesting
                narrative, not in the ahistorically uninterrupted success of an
                empire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disease is a hugely destructive, unstoppable enemy
                that has laughed in the face of pre-modern humanity’s best efforts to build safe
                and stable societies. In addition to its potential for shaking up otherwise
                static strategic situations, it’s a compelling villain for the grand narratives
                these games can generate. Brutal pandemics could bring elements of the roguelike
                genre to strategy games. In Darkest Dungeon, my veteran, golden-boy crusader can
                come down with rabies, syphilis, and yes, even the Black Death. Like most turns
                of misfortune in that game, I have to figure out how to soldier on and deal with
                it. The onset of disease isn’t necessarily an interesting decision for you to
                make. It’s a harbinger of tougher decisions ahead, and a compelling reminder
                that history is fickle, and humanity doesn’t always have a strong hand on the
                tiller of its own fate.&lt;/p&gt;

                1995&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;don't forget to tell me&amp;nbsp;how wrong I
                am!&amp;mdash;is releasing this month, on&amp;nbsp;April 28, to be exact. It's
                an old-fashioned survival horror made to look like an early PlayStation game,
                with all the warping textures and absent anti-aliasing you'd expect. If you were
                to compare it to the similar&amp;nbsp;Silent Hill, you'd see a game that looks
                less technologically advanced&amp;mdash;but&amp;nbsp;remember, Silent Hill came
                out in 1999, four years after the period that creator&amp;nbsp;Takaaki Ichijo is
                trying to recapture. Anyway, here's what Back in 1995 looks like. Haters of
                low-&lt;em&gt;low&lt;/em&gt;-poly, and massively blown up textures, should
                vacate the building now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe width="854" height="480"

                target="_blank"&gt;Steam page&lt;/a&gt;, which reveals that Back in 1995 was
                "created as a labour of love by indie developer Takaaki Ichijo as a means to
                replicate the unique feeling he had from his first gaming experiences: the
                PlayStation and the Sega Saturn".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Be transported to a world
                both concrete and indistinct, where you must uncover the mystery surrounding the
                disappearance of your daughter, the catastrophe that shook the city, and why
                you’ve decided to finally return."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're itching to see

                alt="Corpse Party"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corpse Party is one of the stars of the
                venerable&amp;nbsp;RPG Maker: a grisly horror game set in a
                ghost-infested&amp;nbsp;Japanese high school, with a branching story and lots of
                ways to end up dead. I've been trying to untangle it's mess of remakes for about
                twenty minutes now, but one thing seems certain: the only
                version&amp;nbsp;currently&amp;nbsp;available for PC, in English,
                is&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
                href="http://www.memoriesoffear.com/games_corpsepartypc98/index.html"
                target="_blank"&gt;this unofficial remake&lt;/a&gt; of the
                original&amp;nbsp;1998 version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might not want to play
                that. You might want to play a version of the game more in-line with the
                graphically and aurally enhanced, and generally embiggened PSP version of Corpse
                Party instead. Thankfully, such a thing is coming on Monday April 25, to
                GOG.com, the Humble Store, and Steam. Here is a trailer announcing
                that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe width="500" height="281"

                href="http://xseedgames.tumblr.com/post/142874655105/corpse-party-pc-3ds-victims-memoirs-1"
                target="_blank"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; from publisher XSEED, explaining how the
                PC version differs from the 3DS and PSP versions of Corpse
                Party:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Main benefits of playing this version: Completely
                different Japanese voice track with different nuances, to such an extent that
                much of the game’s dialogue was re-edited to account for subtle shifts in mood
                and tone. The “Tooth” chapter from Corpse Party: Book of Shadows, fully
                recreated here in classic 2D adventure style; easily the biggest and most
                involved Extra Chapter in any Corpse Party game to date, thoroughly expanding
                upon its Book of Shadows counterpart and providing lots of new content both in
                terms of story and gameplay alike. The presence of a genuinely fast fast-forward
                feature, making ending collection a breeze. And last but not least&amp;hellip;
                those beautiful, beautiful text boxes! Seriously, those have to be the
                swankiest, most mesmerizing text boxes I’ve ever seen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeez,
                get a room. Annoyingly, the PC version is different, but not necessarily
                &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;, as it features fewer extra chapters,
                and&amp;nbsp;lower-res characters than the 3DS game. Some of the content is also
                different, for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The rumor is, some of the content
                from the PC version was removed for the handheld ports solely to prevent the
                game from getting too high a CERO rating in Japan, but I’m&amp;hellip; honestly
                not sure if that’s true or not. There are definitely some endings unique to the
                PC version, but none of them seem any more gruesome than some of the endings
                present in all versions of Corpse Party. There’s a rather unsettling
                insect-related scene in the PC game that isn’t present in the PSP version, but
                that’s likely because the PC game was released episodically in Japan, and
                Chapter 5 (where the scene in question plays) didn’t actually come out until
                after the PSP game, meaning it’s more of an addition for PC fans than an
                omission for PSPers. (This is supported by the scene’s subsequent inclusion in
                the 3DS version of the game.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Other than the odd ending here
                and there, the only thing I know for certain that was removed from the PC
                version when it made the jump to PSP is&amp;hellip; a trail of blood on the
                hallway floor during one particular scene. I can’t say for certain why that was
                removed, but I don’t see how it would’ve affected the game’s content rating when
                other parts of the game are far, far more disturbing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How
                incredibly confusing! Corpse Party hits PC on April 25, and it will set you back
                $14.99 (if you pay for things in United States dollars;&amp;nbsp;no other prices
                have been revealed yet).&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt;Be warned, light spoilers for the Dark Souls
                series below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If there’s anything we need to ‘git
                gud’ at, it’s treating Dark Souls as something more than a vessel for primping
                tough guy video game egos worldwide. The Dark Souls community isn’t hung up on
                the series’ notorious difficulty, even if Bandai Namco’s marketing won’t let
                them forget how damn hard the games are. Leading up to and following Dark Souls
                3’s release, it’s likely you’ve read a comment or tweet glorifying the inclusive
                ‘git gud’ mentality, but none compare to the &lt;a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uH3OGfQpu8"&gt;commercial directed by Eli
                Roth&lt;/a&gt;, an animated montage of torturous dark fantasy nonsense that
                fails to say anything other than 'this shit is dark, y’awl,' or the meme
                pastiche merchandise splattered with quotes and in-jokes that only serve to
                portray Dark Souls 3 as something of a secret club that you just wouldn’t
                understand, &lt;em&gt;casual&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I’m not surprised to
                see so many players discouraged by this perspective. It’s an inclusive,
                reductive way to categorize the game. Yes, the games are hard, they’re cryptic,
                and not easy to get into, but the difficulty is just one component of what makes
                each Dark Souls game so cohesive and intriguing, a buttress for the feeling of
                embarking on a long journey. And along the way,&amp;nbsp;death turns into an
                excuse for playful experimentation, and the unpredictable drama of online
                interactions set the stage for stories that no other medium
                can.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Get curious&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; I’ll never
                forget my first look out over Dark Souls 3’s Lothric from a perch in the high
                castle&amp;mdash;the Cathedral of the Deep, cloudy Irithyll, the visible rot of
                the Undead Settlement. I wasn’t certain I’d see much of it. But I wound up
                snaking my way through it all, and at one juncture, I went down. Like,
                beneath-the-crust down. And at a point in that detour, I discovered a makeshift
                ladder and went down further still. What I found didn't just speak to the true
                state of the world, but spoke to the nature of it on a fundamental scale,
                spelling out in piles of charred, petrified demons that even chaos has a
                lifespan in this world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;img
                data-fullimage-src="http://0cb8dd5d2dc142d08f0f-eb3b436d25971e5860b39e72b0600342.r94.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/J0xNMZywQnGr.png"

                alt="Dark Souls 3 Tips 02"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Getting there wasn’t easy, and
                I’m happy for it. Because every enemy has the potential to kill you, an
                overriding tension piggybacks every step further into the world. With my shield
                up, I tip-toed through the first time, scrutinizing every nook of the
                environment. If I didn’t feel the need for caution and studied the environment
                like I did, it’s likely I would have missed out on the subtle cues that spurred
                me downward on my descent. I wouldn’t have noticed the sway and fragility of the
                rope bridge I cut to make a ladder. I wouldn’t have been able to make the
                connection between the Smouldering Lake and and the Ash Lake from the original
                Dark Souls. I wouldn’t have had any revelation about the unspoken story of this
                world and the centuries of history between. Difficulty is leveraged to encourage
                players to pay close attention, and significantly rewards that attention with
                story details, treasure, and the sense of a long, arduous distance
                traveled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Get dramatic&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; But a few threats
                aren’t observable. PvP invasions initially turned me away from Dark Souls. I
                didn’t like the spontaneity of a skilled player seeking me out in an already
                threatening, albeit rigid world. In time, I’ve learned that the environments are
                a large stage on which the actors (players defined by their covenant roles)
                embark on improvisational journeys of trust, deceit, and
                surprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reddit user PuppetShowJustice recalls &lt;a
                href="https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls3/comments/4emha4/my_first_time_being_summoned_as_a_mound_maker_was/"&gt;a
                particularly tragic tale&lt;/a&gt; on the /r/darksouls3 subreddit. To summarize,
                he’s summoned as a Mound Maker, a purple phantom whose ambiguous role is to help
                or murder their host. He decides to earn the trust of his host, helping kill
                enemies all the way until the boss door, which Mound Makers cannot pass through.
                The host summons a Sun phantom to help them with the boss, who sees the Mound
                Maker, assumes they’re evil, and attempts to kill them. The host emotes with
                reckless abandon in a futile effort to get the Sun phantom’s attention, but the
                message is lost. To save his purple friend, the host leaps off a cliff and dies,
                sending both the phantoms back to their own worlds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe
                width="500" height="281" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/xiB_Sqf17vY"
                frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt; In my
                experience, I’ve chased helpless hosts across the Farron Keep swamp only for
                blue sentinels to show up at the last second and chase me back the same way.
                I’ve disguised myself as a statue in a bid for surprise. (The host player had it
                figured out immediately, and in a playful gesture, used the same spell to turn
                into a statue as well. We danced and skittered around as statues for a good five
                minutes before I bowed and returned to my world.) I’ve helped first time players
                finish some of the hardest bosses time and time again, not because I get a few
                minor covenant rewards, but because I know they might be frustrated. Dark Souls’
                covenants don’t give you a rigid online role to inhabit, and like the solo
                journey, they encourage playing around with the potential within each. The
                result is a spontaneous, unpredictable cluster of human drama with a
                lighthearted edge&amp;mdash;everyone wants to find their
                fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Get playful&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; Good thing it’s so easy
                to find fun in a dark fantasy toy box. When death in Dark Souls strips me of
                small achievements, like progress through the environment and collected souls, I
                have nothing left to lose. I’m free from dread and consequence, I know what’s
                ahead, and I’m ready to throw myself at it. The fulcrum for challenge shifts
                from evading death to embracing it. Death is an opportunity to find chinks in
                the armor of a boss, a better strategy for taking on a group of enemies, or to
                test out new armor set with different resistances. The fulcrum becomes how much
                I’m willing to experiment and play with the tools provided, and there are
                plenty: dozens of armor sets and weapons, over 100 rings with accompanying buffs
                and debuffs, spells, pyromancy, summons, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
                With enough nihilistic creativity, there’s always a way through.
                &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; What felt impossible and overbearing a few minutes
                ago might remain a challenge, but now I treat it like a playground for
                experimentation. With enough nihilistic creativity, there’s always a way
                through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dark Souls’ difficulty is not about being a ‘real
                gamer’ or ‘gitting gud.’ It’s the foundation for a variety of unique experiences
                that require a bit of strain and experimentation to reach. And while a series of
                perfectly timed dodge rolls or sword swipes can be immensely satisfying, the
                bulk of the Dark Souls community’s fascination doesn’t begin and end there. The
                Dark Souls community cares about manners. Should we expect to begin every
                invasion duel with a friendly bow? They care about deciphering the lore. Who the
                hell is Pontiff Sulyvahn and why is he such a mean pope? They care about rolling
                into every wall and jumping off every ledge until there’s nothing left to know
                about Dark Souls (god forbid). It’s the fervent desire to know something
                completely&amp;mdash;its physical space, abstract rules, social (dis)courtesies,
                and deep lore&amp;mdash;that should be the brightest signal light for wary

            <description>Aer is an "exploration adventure among the clouds," set to come out
                later this year.</description>

                &lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XcRMw8lTiIU?rel=0"
                allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="343"
                width="610"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt; We mentioned the
                lofty&amp;nbsp;exploration game Aer a couple of months ago in our “&lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/best-pc-games-2016/11/"&gt;Guide to the Games of
                2016&lt;/a&gt;,” in which we said it looks gorgeous and “sounds pretty chill.”
                Based on the gameplay trailer released today by publisher Daedalic
                Entertainment, I think it's fair to say that we were right on the
                money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The trailer doesn't do much to clear up what the game
                is all about, so I'll let the YouTube description do the talking. “In a freely
                explorable world you will follow Auk, a girl who can transform into a bird, on a
                journey through the Land of Gods. You will visit nomads and spirit animals, and
                venture down into ruins from an ancient civilization,” it says. “The gods of old
                are forgotten, lost in the events that left the lands shattered into islands in
                the sky. On your journey you will encounter events that have not been seen in
                generations, and every step leads you closer towards the end of the world. It’s
                up to you to seek out the secrets that can help you save it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                Transitions from human to bird and back will be “seamless," Daedalic said, and
                players will be able to go where they want, complete objectives, and discover
                secrets without restrictions. It's clearly a far cry from the point-and-click
                adventures it's best known for publishing, like &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/silence-the-whispered-world-2-has-a-new-cinematic-trailer/"&gt;Whispered
                World&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/daedalic-announces-deponia-doomsday-coming-next-week/"&gt;Deponia&lt;/a&gt;,
                but I think it sounds fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aer is set to come out
                sometime in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img

                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/the-elder-scrolls-legends-is-a-f2p-strategy-card-game/"&gt;The
                Elder Scrolls: Legends&lt;/a&gt;, a free-to-play strategy card game that might
                remind you of another certain F2P game that's popular with lapsed slot machine
                addicts, is now in closed beta. “Selected registrants” will begin playing the
                game today&amp;mdash;and may already be doing so!&amp;mdash;while additional
                players will be invited behind the velvet rope over the next few
                months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bethesda said TES: Legends is “built with all levels
                of players in mind,” with easy accessibility for beginners and plenty of depth
                for the more competitive cardslingers among you. It features a single-player
                campaign which will serve as a tutorial and “jump-start your collection” of
                cards, as well as multiple online modes. Decks will actually have “&lt;a
                href="https://legends.bethesda.net/world/classes?locale=en"&gt;classes&lt;/a&gt;,”
                based on the RPG-style attributes used to craft them: Strength and agility will
                give you an Archer deck, for instance, while intelligence and willpower combine
                to make&amp;nbsp;a Mage deck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Legends also brings plenty of
                eye-candy to the card table, which despite its strategy underpinnings will be an
                important part of elevating it to the status of full-on&amp;nbsp;&lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/three-card-game-alternatives-to-hearthstone/"&gt;Hearthstone
                competitor&lt;/a&gt;. And that's really what will make or break it: Legends may
                be very good in its own right, but making meaningful headway in a field that's
                already so thoroughly dominated by a well-established (and, superficially at
                least, very similar) competitor is inevitably going to be an uphill fight. But
                hey, it's not like Bethesda hasn't been &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/the-elder-scrolls-online/"&gt;down that road
                before&lt;/a&gt;, right?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To be fair, I think it
                looks promising. TES: Legends offers enough uniqueness, like the Sol Forge-style
                "lanes" on the game board, to at least potentially differentiate itself, and
                Bethesda is one of the few game dev outfits that has both a property of
                sufficient standing&amp;mdash;The Elder Scrolls&amp;mdash;and the development
                muscle to compete with Blizzard on an equal footing. You can find out more about
                The Elder Scrolls: Legends, and sign up for the beta, at &lt;a

                alt="Corsair K65 RGB RapidFire"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corsair didn't waste any
                time as the exclusive launch partner of Cherry's new MX Speed key switches with
                ultra-fast click action. Hot on the heels of &lt;a
                href="http://www.pcgamer.com/cherry-launches-mx-speed-mechanical-key-switch-for-faster-click-action"&gt;Cherry's
                announcement&lt;/a&gt;, Corsair unveiled three new RapidFire mechanical keyboard
                models, each of which use the new key switches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We'll start
                with the &lt;a
                href="http://www.corsair.com/en-us/k65-rgb-rapidfire-compact-mechanical-gaming-keyboard-cherry-mx-speed-rgb-na"
                target="_blank"&gt;K65 RGB RapidFire&lt;/a&gt;. It's a tenkeyless keyboard,
                meaning it ditches the dedicated number pad for a compact design. It's
                essentially the same keyboard as Corsair's non-RapidFire K65 RGB, but with
                Cherry MX Speed key switches under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cherry MX Speed
                is now the fastest MX mechanical switch in Cherry's lineup. With a low 1.2 mm
                actuation and a lightweight operation of just 45 grams, it's 40 percent faster
                than standard Cherry MX Red switches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with the original K65
                RGB, the new RapidFire variant is sleek looking with an aircraft-grade anodized
                brushed aluminum frame that pits the keys in a valley between the top and bottom
                sections. It also features large font keycaps, multiple color per key
                backlighting, media controls along the top portion, a USB pass-through port, and
                a detachable soft-touch wrist rest. Corsair also chucks in textured FPS and MOBA
                keycap sets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img

                target="_blank"&gt;K70 RGB RapidFire&lt;/a&gt; is the full size version with a
                dedicated number pad. It uses the same Cherry MX Speed key switches and offers
                the same features as the K60 RGB RapidFire, plus a few additional media buttons
                and a metal volume roller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img

                target="_blank"&gt;K70 RapidFire&lt;/a&gt; is yet another variant with Cherry MX
                Speed switches, and the only difference between it and the RGB version is the
                backlight&amp;mdash;red is the only color option on the K70
                RapidFire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The K70 RapidFire RGB ($170), K65 RGB RapidFire
                ($150), and K70 RapidFire ($130) are all available now.&lt;/p&gt;
